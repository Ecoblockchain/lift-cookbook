How to add a new recipe to this Cookbook
========================================

Problem
-------

You'd like to add a new page to this cookbook.

Solution
--------

If you're comfortable using Git, you can fork the repository and send a push request.

Alternatively, download the template file, write your recipe, and email to the Lift mailing list.

The template is: [https://raw.github.com/d6y/lift-cookbook/master/template.md](https://raw.github.com/d6y/lift-cookbook/master/template.md)


Discussion
----------

The cookbook is structured using Markdown and Pamflet.  Each recipe is a file with the same structure as the template file, and gives one good solution to a problem.  Feel free to discuss alternatives or related concepts in the discussion section.

If you've forked the project from Github, you'll find all the pages in the `docs` folder, with sub-folders for each section.  The filenames are used for ordering the pages and sections.  Feel free to send pull requests.

How to report bugs
==================

Problem
-------

You've found a bug and want to report it.

Solution
--------

Discuss your findings on the Lift mailing list, saying what you're seeing, and what you'd expect to see.

By all means look at [existing issues](https://github.com/lift/modules/issues) to see if your issue is there or recently fixed, but do not raise a ticket unless asked to do so by a Lift committer on the mailing list.


Discussion
----------

__"If Lift is not behaving as you expect, please ask questions about what you're seeing. The ideal form of these questions is 'When I do X, my Lift app does Y, but I expect it to do Z, why?' This provides a set of language to discuss your application and the way that Lift responds to requests. Perhaps there's a way of improving Lift. Perhaps there's a concept that's different in Lift than you might be used to. Perhaps there's a documentation issue that can help bridge the gap between what Lift is doing and what you expect it to do. Most importantly, just because Lift is behaving differently than you expect it to, it's not necessarily a bug in Lift."__ (from [Expected Behavior in the Lift community](http://lift.la/expected-behavior-in-the-lift-community))
