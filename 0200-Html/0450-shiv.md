Including HTML5 Shiv 
====================

Problem
-------

You want to include HTML5 Shiv (a.k.a. HTML5 Shim) so you can use HTML5 elements with legacy IE browsers.

Solution
--------

Put the markup in a snippet and include the snippet in your page or template.

```scala
package code.snippet

import scala.xml.Unparsed

object Html5Shiv {        
  def render = Unparsed("""<!--[if lt IE 9]>
  <script src="http://html5shim.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/html5.js">
  </script><![endif]-->""")
}
```

Reference the snippet in the `<head>` of your `templates-hidden/default.html`, e.g.,:

```html
<script class="lift:Html5Shiv"></script>
```

Discussion
----------

The HTML5 parser used by Lift does not carry comments from the source through to the rendered page.  If you're looking at `Unparsed` and worried, your instincts are correct, but in this case we do want unparsed XML content (the comment tag) included in the output.
