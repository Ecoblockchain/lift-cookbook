Resources
=========

** Intake PDFs: 
   (Git repo) pdf/drafts/intake.pdf
   (Git repo) pdf/drafts/intake_with_remarks.pdf

** Figs: Illustrations is still working on the figs. 
   10 total. (0 are informal; 0 are inline.)

   Once the figs are processed on /work, you'll need to add them to the book's repo in Git.

** Intake Report:
   (Git repo) tools/intakereport.txt

** MS Snapshot:
    To view the submitted files, you'll need to checkout the git tag named 'manuscript_to_prod' 
    by running the following command in your checkout:
    
    $ git checkout manuscript_to_prod
    
    This will temporarily switch the files in your repo to the state they were in when the manuscript_to_prod tag 
    was created. 
    To switch the files back to the current state, run:
    
    $ git checkout master
  
  
Notes from Tools:
=================

** Syntax highlighting: applied to 410 out of 479 code listings.

** Author left chapter 8 (08-Mapper.asciidoc) out of the PDF builds. Emailed him to ask if this was intentional. I left it out of the builds for now; once we hear back please either add it into the builds or remove it from the repo.

** Please let Tools know ASAP if there are any other global problems for which we can help automate a fix.


Notes from Dan:
==================

This book is ready for Realtime intake.

Prod:
* Inconsistent capitalization of headings
* Please shorten urls and anchor them to text. Anchoring the text would be a great improvement, but there are a lot of urls. Sorry.

From the editor:
Other general notes:
Author may need to make some small tweaks during QC

==================

Please let me know about any other issues.

Thanks,
Jess
