[[Ajax]]
JavaScript, Ajax, and Comet
---------------------------

Lift is known for its great Ajax and Comet support, and in this chapter, we'll explore these.

For an introduction to Lift's Ajax and Comet features, see http://simply.liftweb.net[_Simply Lift_], Chapter 9 of _Lift in Action_ (Perrett, 2012, Manning Publications, Co.), or watch https://fmpwizard.telegr.am/blog/comet-actors-presentation[Diego Medina's video presentation].

[[ButtonTriggerServerCode]]
Trigger Server-Side Code from a Button
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

You want to trigger some server-side code when the user presses a
button.((("Ajax", "server-side code triggering", id="ix_AJssc", range="startofrange")))((("ajaxInvoke", id="ix_AIssc", range="startofrange")))(((radio buttons)))((("server-side code", "triggering with buttons")))


Solution
^^^^^^^^

Use `ajaxInvoke`:

[source,scala]
----
package code.snippet

import net.liftweb.util.Helpers._
import net.liftweb.http.SHtml
import net.liftweb.http.js.{JsCmd, JsCmds}
import net.liftweb.common.Loggable

object AjaxInvoke extends Loggable {

  def callback() : JsCmd = {
    logger.info("The button was pressed")
    JsCmds.Alert("You clicked it")
  }

  def button = "button [onclick]" #> SHtml.ajaxInvoke(callback)
}
----

In this snippet, we are binding the click event of a button to an `ajaxInvoke`: when the button is pressed, Lift
arranges for the function you gave `ajaxInvoke` to be executed.

That function, `callback`, is just logging a message and returning a JavaScript alert to the browser. The corresponding HTML might include:

[source,html]
----
<div data-lift="AjaxInvoke.button">
  <button>Click Me</button>
</div>
----

Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

The signature of the function you pass to `ajaxInvoke` is
`Unit => JsCmd`, meaning you can trigger a range of behaviours, from
returning `Noop` if you want nothing to happen, through changing DOM
elements, all the way up to executing arbitrary JavaScript.

The previous example uses a button but will work on any element that
has an event you can bind to.  We're binding to `onclick` but it could be any event
the DOM exposes.

Related to `ajaxInvoke` are the following functions:

`SHtml.onEvent`:: Calls a function with the signature `String => JsCmd` because it
is passed the `value` of the node it is attached to. In the previous
example, this would be the empty string, as the button has no value.
`SHtml.ajaxCall`:: This is more general than `onEvent`, as you give it the expression you want passed to your server-side code.((("SHtml.", "ajaxCall")))(((ajaxCall)))
`SHtml.jsonCall`::  This is even more general still: you give it a function
that will return a JSON object when executed on the client, and this
object will be passed to your server-side function.((("SHtml.", "jsonCall")))(((jsonCall)))

Let's look at each of these in turn.

onEvent: receiving the value of a DOM element
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You can use `onEvent` with any element that has a `value` attribute and responds to the event you choose to bind to. The function you supply to `onEvent` is called with the element's value. As an example, we can write a snippet that presents a challenge to the user and validates the response(((SHtml.onEvent)))(((onEvent))):

[source,scala]
----
package code.snippet

import scala.util.Random
import net.liftweb.util.Helpers._
import net.liftweb.http.SHtml
import net.liftweb.http.js.JsCmds.Alert

object OnEvent {

  def render = {
    val x, y = Random.nextInt(10)
    val sum = x + y

    "p *" #> "What is %d + %d?".format(x,y) &
    "input [onchange]" #> SHtml.onEvent( answer =>
      if (answer == sum.toString) Alert("Correct!")
      else Alert("Try again")
     )
  }

}
----

This snippet prompts the user to add the two random numbers presented in the `<p>` tag, and binds a validation function to the `<input>` on the page:

[source,html]
----
<div data-lift="OnEvent">
  <p>Problem appears here</p>
  <input placeholder="Type your answer"></input>
</div>
----

When `onchange` is triggered (by pressing Return or the Tab key, for example), the text entered is sent to our `onEvent` function as a `String`. On the server-side, we check the answer and send back "Correct!" or "Try again" as a JavaScript alert.


ajaxCall: receiving an arbitrary client-side string
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Where `onEvent` sends `this.value` to your server-side code, `ajaxCall` allows you to specify the client-side expression used to produce a value.(((ajaxCall)))((("SHtml.", "ajaxCall")))

To demonstrate this, we can create a template that includes two elements: a button and a text field.  We'll bind our function to the button, but read a value from the input field:

[source,html]
----
<div data-lift="AjaxCall">
  <input id="num" value="41"></input>
  <button>Increment</button>
</div>
----

We want to arrange for the button to read the `num` field, increment it, and return it back to the input field:

[source,scala]
----
package code.snippet

import net.liftweb.util.Helpers._
import net.liftweb.http.SHtml
import net.liftweb.http.js.JE.ValById
import net.liftweb.http.js.JsCmds._

object AjaxCall {

 def increment(in: String) : String =
  asInt(in).map(_ + 1).map(_.toString) openOr in

 def render = "button [onclick]" #>
   SHtml.ajaxCall(ValById("num"), s => SetValById("num", increment(s)) )

 }
----

The first argument to `ajaxCall` is the expression that will produce a value for our function. It can be any `JsExp`, and we've
used `ValById`, which looks up the value of an element by the ID attribute.  We could have used a regular jQuery expression to achieve the same effect with `JsRaw("$('#num').val()")`.

Our second argument to `ajaxCall` takes the value of the `JsExp` expression as a `String`. We're using one of Lift's JavaScript commands to replace the value with a new value. The new value is the result of incrementing the number (providing it is a number).

The end result is that you press the button and the number updates. It should go without saying that these are simple illustrations, and you probably don't want a server round-trip to add one to a number. The techniques come into their own when there is some action of value to perform on the server.

You may have guessed that `onEvent` is implemented as an `ajaxCall` for `JsRaw("this.value")`.


jsonCall: receiving a JSON value
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Both `ajaxCall` and `onEvent` end up evaluating a `String => JsCmd` function. By contrast, `jsonCall` has the signature `JValue => JsCmd`, meaning you can pass more complex data structures from JavaScript to your Lift application.((("SHtml.", "jsonCall")))(((jsonCall)))

To demonstrate this, we'll create a template that asks for input, has a function to convert the input into JSON, and a button to send the JSON to the server:


[source,html]
----
<div data-lift="JsonCall">
  <p>Enter an addition question:</p>
  <div>
    <input id="x"> + <input id="y"> = <input id="z">.
  </div>
  <button>Check</button>
</div>

<script type="text/javascript">
// <![CDATA[
function currentQuestion() {
  return {
    first:  parseInt($('#x').val()),
    second: parseInt($('#y').val()),
    answer: parseInt($('#z').val())
  };
}
// ]]>
----

The `currentQuestion` function is creating an object, which will be turned into a JSON string when sent to the server. On the server, we'll check that this JSON represents a valid integer addition problem:

[source,scala]
----
package code.snippet

import net.liftweb.util.Helpers._
import net.liftweb.http.SHtml
import net.liftweb.http.js.{JsCmd, JE}
import net.liftweb.common.Loggable
import net.liftweb.json.JsonAST._
import net.liftweb.http.js.JsCmds.Alert
import net.liftweb.json.DefaultFormats

object JsonCall extends Loggable {

  implicit val formats = DefaultFormats

  case class Question(first: Int, second: Int, answer: Int) {
    def valid_? = first + second == answer
  }

  def render = {

    def validate(value: JValue) : JsCmd = {
      logger.info(value)
      value.extractOpt[Question].map(_.valid_?) match {
        case Some(true) => Alert("Looks good")
        case Some(false) => Alert("That doesn't add up")
        case None => Alert("That doesn't make sense")
      }
    }

    "button [onclick]" #>
      SHtml.jsonCall( JE.Call("currentQuestion"), validate _ )
  }
}
----

Working from the bottom of this snippet up, we see a binding of the `<button>` to the `jsonCall`. The value we'll be working on is the value provided by the JavaScript function called `currentQuestion`.  This was defined on the template page.  When the button is clicked, the JavaScript function is called and the resulting value will be presented to `validate`, which is our `JValue => JsCmd` function.

All `validate` does is log the JSON data and alert back if the question looks correct or not.  To do this, we use the Lift JSON ability to extract JSON to a case class and call the `valid_?` test to see if the numbers add up.  This will evaluate to `Some(true)` if the addition works, `Some(false)` if the addition isn't correct, or `None` if the input is missing or not a valid integer.

Running the code and entering 1, 2, and 3 into the text fields will produce the following in the server log:

[source,scala]
----
JObject(List(JField(first,JInt(1)), JField(second,JInt(2)),
  JField(answer,JInt(3))))
----

This is the `JValue` representation of the JSON.

<<SelectOptionChange>> includes an example of `SHtml.onEvents`, which will bind a function to a number of events on a `NodeSeq`.

For another example of `AjaxInvoke`, take a look at the http://blog.fmpwizard.com/scala-lift-custom-wizard[_Call Scala code from JavaScript_ section] of Diego Medina's blog.

http://exploring.liftweb.net/master/index-10.html[_Exploring Lift_, Chapter 10], lists various `JsExp` classes you can use for `ajaxCall`.

<<JsonForms>> using `JsonHandler` to send JSON data from a form to the server.(((range="endofrange", startref="ix_AJssc")))(((range="endofrange", startref="ix_AIssc")))


[[SelectOptionChange]]
Call Server When Select Option Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

When an HTML select option is selected, you want to trigger a function on the server.((("functions", "triggering with HTML select option")))((("server-side code", "triggering with HTML select option")))(((HTML, select options)))


Solution
^^^^^^^^

Register a `String => JsCmd` function with `SHtml.ajaxSelect`.((("SHtml.", "ajaxSelect")))(((ajaxSelect)))(((JavaScript, server-side function triggering with)))((("String JsCmd function")))

In this example, we will look up the distance from Earth to the planet a user selects.  This lookup will
happen on the server and update the browser with the result. The pass:[<phrase role='keep-together'>interface is:</phrase>]

[source, html]
-----
<div data-lift="HtmlSelectSnippet">
  <div>
    <label for="dropdown">Planet:</label>
    <select id="dropdown"></select>
  </div>
  <div id="distance">Distance will appear here</div>
</div>
-----

The snippet code binds the `<select>` element to send the selected value to the server:

[source, scala]
-----
package code.snippet

import net.liftweb.common.Empty
import net.liftweb.util.Helpers._
import net.liftweb.http.SHtml.ajaxSelect
import net.liftweb.http.js.JsCmd
import net.liftweb.http.js.JsCmds.SetHtml
import xml.Text

class HtmlSelectSnippet {

  // Our "database" maps planet names to distances:
  type Planet = String
  type LightYears = Double

  val database = Map[Planet,LightYears](
    "Alpha Centauri Bb" -> 4.23,
    "Tau Ceti e" -> 11.90,
    "Tau Ceti f" -> 11.90,
    "Gliese 876 d" -> 15.00,
    "82 G Eridani b" -> 19.71
  )

  def render = {

    // To show the user a blank label and blank value option:
    val blankOption = ("" -> "")

    // The complete list of options includes everything in our database:
    val options : List[(String,String)] =
      blankOption ::
      database.keys.map(p => (p,p)).toList

    // Nothing is selected by default:
    val default = Empty

    // The function to call when an option is picked:
    def handler(selected: String) : JsCmd = {
      SetHtml("distance", Text(database(selected) + " light years"))
    }

    // Bind the <select> tag:
    "select" #> ajaxSelect(options, default, handler)
  }
}
-----

The last line of the code is doing the work for us.  It is generating the options and binding
the selection to a function called `handler`.  The `handler` function is called with the value
of the selected item.

We're using the same `String` (the planet name) for the option label and value, but they could be
different.

Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

To understand what's going on here, take a look at the HTML that Lift produces:

[source, html]
-----
<select id="dropdown"
  onchange="liftAjax.lift_ajaxHandler('F470183993611Y15ZJU=' +
    this.options[this.selectedIndex].value, null, null, null)">
  <option value=""></option>
  <option value="Tau Ceti e">Tau Ceti e</option>
  ...
</select>
-----

The `handler` function has been stored by Lift under the identifier of `F470183993611Y15ZJU` (in this particular rendering). An `onchange` event handler is attached to the `<select>` element and is responsible for transporting the selected value to the server, and bringing a value back. The `lift_ajaxHandler` JavaScript function is defined in _liftAjax.js_, which is automatically added to your page.


Collecting the value on form submission
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you need to additionally capture the selected value on a regular form submission, you can make use of `SHtml.onEvents`.  This attaches event listeners to a `NodeSeq`, triggering a server-side function when the event occurs.  We can use this with a regular form with a regular select box, but wire in Ajax calls to the server when the select changes.((("forms processing", "collecting values from")))(((SHtml.onEvent)))(((onEvent)))((("values", "collecting upon form submission")))((("S.", "notice")))

To make use of this, our snippet changes very little:

[source, scala]
----
var selectedValue : String = ""

"select" #> onEvents("onchange")(handler) {
  select(options, default, selectedValue = _)
} &
"type=submit" #> onSubmitUnit( () => S.notice("Destination "+selectedValue))
----

We are arranging for the same `handler` function to be called when an `onchange` event is triggered.  This event binding is applied to a regular `SHtml.select`, which is storing the `selectedValue` when the form is submitted. We also bind a submit button to a function that generates a notice of which planet was selected.

The corresponding HTML also changes little.  We need to add a button and make sure the snippet is marked as a form with `?form`:

[source,html]
----
<div data-lift="HtmlSelectFormSnippet?form=post">

  <div>
    <label for="dropdown">Planet:</label>
    <select id="dropdown"></select>
  </div>

  <div id="distance">Distance will appear here</div>

  <input type="submit" value="Book Ticket"/>

</div>
----

Now when you change a selected value, you see the dynamically updated distance calculation, but pressing the "Book Ticket" button also delivers the value to the server.

<<MultiSelectBox>> describes how to use classes rather than `String` values for select boxes.



[[ClientSideOnlyActions]]
Creating Client-Side Actions in Your Scala Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

In your Lift code you want to set up an action that is run purely in
client-side JavaScript.(((JavaScript, client-side function triggering with)))((("functions", "server-side code and")))(((Scala, client-side actions and)))((("submit buttons", seealso="radio buttons")))

Solution
^^^^^^^^

Bind your JavaScript directly to the event handler you want to run.

Here's an example where we make a button slowly fade away when you press it, but notice
that we're setting up this binding in our server-side Lift code:

[source,scala]
----
package code.snippet

import net.liftweb.util.Helpers._

object ClientSide {
  def render = "button [onclick]" #> "$(this).fadeOut()"
}
----

In the template, we'd perhaps say:

[source,html]
----
<div data-lift="ClientSide">
  <button>Click Me</button>
</div>
----

Lift will render the page as:

[source,html]
----
<button onclick="$(this).fadeOut()">Click Me</button>
----

Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

Lift includes a JavaScript abstraction that you can use to build up
more elaborate expressions for the client-side. For example, you can
combine basic commands:

[source,scala]
----
import net.liftweb.http.js.JsCmds.{Alert, RedirectTo}

def render = "button [onclick]" #>
  (Alert("Here we go...") & RedirectTo("http://liftweb.net"))
----

This pops up an alert dialog(((alert dialog boxes)))(((dialog boxes))) and then sends you to _http://liftweb.net_. The HTML would be rendered as:

[source,html]
----
<button onclick="alert(&quot;Here we go...&quot;);
window.location = &quot;http://liftweb.net&quot;;">Click Me</button>
----

Another option is to use `JE.Call` to execute a JavaScript function with
parameters. Suppose we have this function defined:

[source,javascript]
----
function greet(who, times) {
  for(i=0; i<times; i++)
    alert("Hello "+who);
}
----

We could bind a client-side button press to this client-side function
like this:

[source,scala]
----
import net.liftweb.http.js.JE

def render =
  "button [onclick]" #> JE.Call("greet", "World!", 3)
----

On the client-side, we'd see:

[source,html]
----
<button onclick="greet(&quot;World!&quot;,3)">Click Me For Greeting</button>
----

Note that the types `String` and `Int` have been preserved in the JavaScript syntax of the call. This has happened because `JE.Call` takes a variable number of `JsExp` arguments after the JavaScript function name. There are wrappers for JavaScript primitive types (`JE.Str`, `JE.Num`, `JsTrue`, `JsFalse`) and implicit conversions to save you having to wrap the Scala values yourself.


See Also
^^^^^^^^

http://exploring.liftweb.net/[Chapter 10 of _Exploring Lift_] gives a list of `JsCmds` and `JE` expressions.


[[FocusOnLoad]]
Focus on a Field on Page Load
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

When a page loads, you want the browser to select a particular field for
input from the keyboard.(((JavaScript, field focus with)))(((FocusOnLoad command)))((("browsers", "field focus in")))(((field focus)))

Solution
^^^^^^^^

Wrap the input with a `FocusOnLoad` command:

[source,scala]
----
package code.snippet

import net.liftweb.util.Helpers._
import net.liftweb.http.js.JsCmds.FocusOnLoad

class Focus {
  def render = "name=username" #> FocusOnLoad(<input type="text"/>)
}
----

The CSS transform in `render` will match against a `name="username"` element in the HTML and
replace it with a text input field that will be focused on automatically
when the page loads.((("Lift Web Framework", "CSS selector transforms")))

Although we're focusing on inline HTML, this could be any `NodeSeq`, such as the one produced by `SHtml.text`.

Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

`FocusOnLoad` is an example of a `NodeSeq => NodeSeq` transformation. It appends to the `NodeSeq` with the
JavaScript required to set focus on that field.

The JavaScript that performs the focus simply looks up the node in the DOM by ID and calls `focus` on it. Although the previous example code doesn't specify an ID, the `FocusOn` command is smart enough to add one automatically for us.

There are two related `JsCmd` choices:

`Focus`:: Takes an element ID and sets focus on the element
`SetValueAndFocus`:: Similar to `Focus`, but takes an additional
`String` value to populate the element with

These two are useful if you need to set focus from Ajax or Comet
components pass:[<phrase role='keep-together'>dynamically.</phrase>]

See Also
^^^^^^^^

https://github.com/lift/framework/blob/master/web/webkit/src/main/scala/net/liftweb/http/js/JsCommands.scala[The source for `FocusOnLoad`] is worth checking out to understand how it and related commands are constructed.  This may help you package your own JavaScript functionality up into commands that can be used in CSS binding expressions.


[[CSSClassOnAjaxForm]]
Add a CSS Class to an Ajax Form
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

You want to set the CSS class of an Ajax form.((("Ajax", "setting CSS class")))((("CSS classes, setting on Ajax forms")))(((query parameters)))

Solution
^^^^^^^^

Name the class via `?class=` query parameter:

[source,html]
----
<form data-lift="form.ajax?class=boxed">
...
</form>
----

Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

If you need to set multiple CSS classes, encode a space between the
class names, e.g., `class=boxed+primary`.

The `form.ajax` construction is a regular snippet call: the `Form` snippet is one of the handful of built-in snippets, and in this case, we're calling the `ajax` method on that object.  However, normally snippet calls do not copy attributes into the resulting markup, but this snippet is implemented to do exactly that.

See Also
^^^^^^^^

[[DynamicTemplateLoading]]
Running a Template via JavaScript
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

You want to load an entire page--a template with snippets--inside of the current page (i.e., without a browser refresh).((("templates", "loading without browser refresh")))((("browsers", "loading pages without refresh")))(((JavaScript, running a template with)))

Solution
^^^^^^^^

Use `Template` to load the template and `SetHtml` to place the content
on the page.(((SetHtml)))

Let's populate a `<div>` with the site home page when a button is pressed:

[source,html]
----
<div data-lift="TemplateLoad">
  <div id="inject">Content will appear here</div>
  <button>Load Template</button>
</div>
----

The corresponding snippet would be:

[source,scala]
----
package code.snippet

import net.liftweb.util.Helpers._
import net.liftweb.http.{SHtml, Templates}
import net.liftweb.http.js.JsCmds.{SetHtml, Noop}
import net.liftweb.http.js.JsCmd

object TemplateLoad {

  def content : JsCmd =
    Templates("index" :: Nil).map(ns => SetHtml("inject", ns)) openOr Noop

  def render = "button [onclick]" #> SHtml.ajaxInvoke(content _)
}
----

Clicking the button will cause the content of _/index.html_ to be
loaded into the `inject` element.

Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

`Templates` produces a `Box[NodeSeq]`.  In the previous example, we map this content into a `JsCmd` that will populate the `inject` `<div>`.

If you write unit tests to access templates, be aware that you may need to modify your development or testing environment to include the _webapps_ folder.  To do this for SBT, add the following to _build.sbt_:((("build.sbt, contents")))

[source,scala]
----
unmanagedResourceDirectories in Test <+= (baseDirectory) { 
  _ / "src/main/webapp" 
}
----

For this to work in your IDE, you'll need to add _webapp_ as a source folder to locate templates.

[[JavaScriptTail]]
Move JavaScript to End of Page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

You want the JavaScript created in your snippet to be included at the end of the HTML page.(((JavaScript, moving to page end)))(((S.appendJs)))(((HTML, moving JavaScript to end of pages)))

Solution
^^^^^^^^

Use `S.appendJs`, which places your JavaScript just before the closing `</body>` tag, along with other JavaScript produced by Lift.((("S.", "appendJs")))

In this HTML, we have placed a `<script>` tag in the middle of the page and marked it with a snippet called `JavaScriptTail`:

[source,html]
-----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<head>
  <meta content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" http-equiv="content-type" />
  <title>JavaScript in Tail</title>
</head>
<body data-lift-content-id="main">
<div id="main" data-lift="surround?with=default;at=content">
  <h2>JavaScript in the tail of the page</h2>

  <script type="text/javascript" data-lift="JavaScriptTail">
  </script>

  <p>
    The JavaScript about to be run will have been moved
    to the end of this page, just before the closing
    body tag.
  </p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
-----

The `<script>` content will be generated by a snippet.
It doesn't need to be a `<script>` tag; the snippet just replaces the content with nothing, but
hanging the snippet on the `<script>` tag is a reminder of the purpose of the snippet:

[source, scala]
-----
package code.snippet

import net.liftweb.util.Helpers._
import net.liftweb.http.js.JsCmds.Alert
import net.liftweb.http.S
import xml.NodeSeq

class JavaScriptTail {
  def render = {
    S.appendJs(Alert("Hi"))
    "*" #> NodeSeq.Empty
  }
}
-----

Although the snippet is rendering nothing, it calls `S.appendJs` with a `JsCmd`.  This will produce the following in the page just before the end of the body:

[source, html]
-----
<script type="text/javascript">
// <![CDATA[
jQuery(document).ready(function() {
  alert("Hi");
});
// ]]>
</script>
-----

Observe that the snippet was in the middle of the template, but the JavaScript appears at the end of the rendered page.


Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

There are three other ways you could tackle this problem.  The first is to move your JavaScript to an external file, and simply include it on the page where you want it.  For substantial JavaScript code, this might make sense.

The second is a variation on `S.appendJs`: `S.appendGlobalJs` works in the same way but does not include the jQuery `ready` around your JavaScript.  This means you have no guarantee the DOM has loaded when your function is called.

A third option is wrap your JavaScript in a `<lift:tail>` snippet:

[source, scala]
-----
class JavascriptTail {
  def render =
    "*" #> <lift:tail>{Script(OnLoad(Alert("Hi")))}</lift:tail>
}
-----

Note that `lift:tail` is a general purpose Lift snippet and can be used to move various kinds of content to the end of the page, not just JavaScript.

[[CometSessionLossJS]]
Run JavaScript on Comet Session Loss
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

You're using a Comet actor and you want to arrange for some JavaScript to be executed in the event of the session being lost.(((Comet, executing JavaScript with)))(((JavaScript, executing with Comet actor)))((("browsers", "handling session loss")))((("LiftRules", ".noCometSessionCmd")))(((session loss)))(((chat sessions)))

Solution
^^^^^^^^

Configure your JavaScript via `LiftRules.noCometSessionCmd`.

As an example, we can modify the standard Lift chat demo to save the message being typed in the event of the session loss.  In the style of the demo, we would have an Ajax form for entering a message and the Comet chat area for displaying messages received:

[source, html]
-----
<form data-lift="form.ajax">
  <input type="text" data-lift="ChatSnippet" id="message"
    placeholder="Type a message" />
</form>

<div data-lift="comet?type=ChatClient">
  <ul>
    <li>A message</li>
  </ul>
</div>
-----

To this we can add a function, `stash`, which we want to be called in the event of a Comet session being lost:

[source, html]
-----
<script type="text/javascript">
// <![CDATA[
function stash() {
  saveCookie("stashed", $('#message').val());
  location.reload();
}

jQuery(document).ready(function() {
  var stashedValue = readCookie("stashed") || "";
  $('#message').val(stashedValue);
  deleteCookie("stashed");
});

// Definition of saveCookie, readCookie, deleteCookie omitted.

</script>
-----

Our `stash` function will save the current value of the input field in a cookie called `stashed`.  We arrange, on page load, to check for that cookie and insert the value into our message field.(((cookies)))(((stash function)))

The final part is to modify _Boot.scala_ to register our `stash` function:

[source, scala]
-----
import net.liftweb.http.js.JsCmds.Run

LiftRules.noCometSessionCmd.default.set( () => Run("stash()") )
-----

In this way, if a session is lost while composing a chat message, the browser will stash the message, and when the page reloads the message will be recovered.

To test the example, type a message into the message field, then restart your Lift application.  Wait 10 seconds, and you'll see the effect.

Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

Without changing `noCometSessionCmd`, the default behaviour of Lift is to arrange for the browser to load the home page, which is controlled by the `LiftRules.noCometSessionPage` setting. This is carried out via the JavaScript function `lift_sessionLost` in the file _cometAjax.js_.

By providing our own `() => JsCmd` function to `LiftRules.noCometSessionCmd`, Lift arranges to call this function and deliver the `JsCmd`  to the browser, rather than `lift_sessionLost`.  If you watch the HTTP traffic between your browser and Lift, you'll see the `stash` function call being returned in response to a Comet request.((("LiftRules" ".noCometSessionCmd")))(((dependency injection)))

.Factory
****
The `noCometSessionCmd.default.set` call is making use of Lift's https://www.assembla.com/spaces/liftweb/wiki/Dependency_Injection[dependency injection]. Specifically, it's setting up the supply side of the dependency. Although we're setting a default here, it's possible in Lift to supply different behaviours with different scopes: request or session.
****

This recipe has focused on the handling of loss of session for Comet; for Ajax, there's a corresponding `LiftRules.noAjaxSessionCmd` setting.

You'll find the _The ubiquitous Chat app_ in http://simply.liftweb.net/[_Simply Lift_].

Being able to debug HTTP traffic is a useful way to understand how your Comet or Ajax application is performing.  There are many plugins and products to help with this, such as the https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/httpfox/[_HttpFox_ plugin for Firefox].




[[AjaxFileUpload]]
Ajax File Upload
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

You want to offer your users an Ajax file upload tool, with progress bars and drag-and-drop support.((("Ajax", "file upload tool")))((("files", "uploading")))(((progress bars)))(((drag-and-drop support)))((("Tschan, Sebastian")))(((jQuery File Upload widget)))((("REST web services", "file uploads")))

Solution
^^^^^^^^

Add Sebastian Tschan's https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload[_jQuery File Upload_ widget] to your project, and implement a REST end point to receive files.

The first step is to download the widget and drag the _js_ folder into your application as _src/main/webapp/js_.  We can then use the JavaScript in a template:

[source,html]
---------------------------------------------------------
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>jQuery File Upload Example</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Drag files onto this page</h1>

<input id="fileupload" type="file" name="files[]" data-url="/upload" multiple>

<div id="progress" style="width:20em; border: 1pt solid silver; display: none">
  <div id="progress-bar" style="background: green; height: 1em; width:0%"></div>
</div>

<script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.3/jquery.min.js">
</script>
<script src="js/vendor/jquery.ui.widget.js"></script>
<script src="js/jquery.iframe-transport.js"></script>
<script src="js/jquery.fileupload.js"></script>

<script>
  $(function () {
    $('#fileupload').fileupload({
      dataType: 'json',
      add: function (e,data) {
        $('#progress-bar').css('width', '0%');
        $('#progress').show();
        data.submit();
      },
      progressall: function (e, data) {
        var progress = parseInt(data.loaded / data.total * 100, 10) + '%';
        $('#progress-bar').css('width', progress);
      },
      done: function (e, data) {
        $.each(data.files, function (index, file) {
          $('<p/>').text(file.name).appendTo(document.body);
        });
        $('#progress').fadeOut();
      }
    });
  });
</script>

</body>
</html>
---------------------------------------------------------

This template provides an input field for files, an area to use as a progress indicator, and configures the widget when the page loads in a jQuery `$( ... )` block.  This is just regular usage of the JavaScript widget, and nothing particularly Lift-specific.

The final part is to implement a Lift REST service to receive the file or files.  The URL of the service, _/upload_, is set in `data-url` on the `input` field, and that's the address we match on:

[source,scala]
---------------------------------------------------------
package code.rest

import net.liftweb.http.rest.RestHelper
import net.liftweb.http.OkResponse

object AjaxFileUpload extends RestHelper {

  serve {

    case "upload" :: Nil Post req =>
      for (file <- req.uploadedFiles) {
        println("Received: "+file.fileName)
      }
      OkResponse()

  }

}
---------------------------------------------------------

This implementation simply logs the name of the file received and acknowledges successful delivery with a 200 status code back to the widget.

As with all REST services, it needs to be registered in _Boot.scala_:

[source,scala]
---------------------------------------------------------
LiftRules.dispatch.append(code.rest.AjaxFileUpload)
---------------------------------------------------------

By default, the widget makes the whole HTML page a drop-target for files, meaning you can drag a file onto the page and it will immediately be uploaded to your Lift application.

Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

In this recipe, we've shown just the basic integration of the widget with a Lift application. http://blueimp.github.com/jQuery-File-Upload/[The demo site for the widget] shows other capabilities, and provides documentation on how to integrate them.

Many of the features just require JavaScript configuration.  For example, we've used the widget's `add`, `progressall`, and `done` handlers to show, update, and then fade out a progress bar.  When the upload is completed, the name of the uploaded file is appended to the page.

In the REST service, the uploaded files are available via the `uploadedFiles` method on the request. When Lift receives a multipart form, it automatically extracts files as pass:[<phrase role='keep-together'><literal>uploadedFiles</literal>,</phrase>] each of which is a `FileParamHolder` that gives us access to the `fileName`, `length`, `mimeType`, and `fileStream`.

By default, uploaded files are held in memory, but that can be changed (see <<UploadToDisk>> in <<FileUpload>>).

In this recipe, we return a 200 (`OkResponse`).  If we wanted to signal to the widget that a file was rejected, we can return another code. For example, perhaps we want to reject all files except PNG images.  On the server-side we can do that by replacing the `OkResponse` with a test:

[source,scala]
---------------------------------------------------------
import net.liftweb.http.{ResponseWithReason, BadResponse, OkResponse}

if (req.uploadedFiles.exists( _.mimeType != "image/png" ))
  ResponseWithReason(BadResponse(), "Only PNGs")
else
  OkResponse()
---------------------------------------------------------

We would mirror this with a `fail` handler in the client JavaScript:

[source,javascript]
---------------------------------------------------------
fail: function (e, data) {
  alert(data.errorThrown);
}
---------------------------------------------------------

If we uploaded, say, a JPEG, the browser would show an alert dialog reporting "Only PNGs."

[[FormatWiring]]
Format A Wired Cell
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

You want a wired UI element to have a different format than plain conversion to a string. For example, you'd like to display a floating-point value as a currency.((("wired cells, formatting")))((("UI elements, wired")))(((floating-point values)))(((currency)))(((WiringUI.toNode method)))

Solution
^^^^^^^^

Use the `WiringUI.toNode` method to create a wiring node that can render the output formatted as you desire.

As an example, consider an HTML template to display the quantity of an item being purchased and the subtotal:

[source,html]
---------------------------------------------------------
<div data-lift="Wiring">

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Quantity</td><td id="quantity">?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Subtotal</td><td id="subtotal">?</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<button id="add">Add Another One</button>

</div>
---------------------------------------------------------

We'd like the subtotal to display as US dollars.  The snippet would be:

[source,scala]
---------------------------------------------------------
package code.snippet

import java.text.NumberFormat
import java.util.Locale

import scala.xml.{NodeSeq, Text}

import net.liftweb.util.Helpers._
import net.liftweb.util.{Cell, ValueCell}
import net.liftweb.http.{S, WiringUI}
import net.liftweb.http.SHtml.ajaxInvoke
import net.liftweb.http.js.JsCmd

class Wiring {

  val cost = ValueCell(1.99)
  val quantity = ValueCell(1)
  val subtotal = cost.lift(quantity)(_ * _)

  val formatter = NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance(Locale.US)

  def currency(cell: Cell[Double]): NodeSeq => NodeSeq =
    WiringUI.toNode(cell)((value, ns) => Text(formatter format value))

  def increment(): JsCmd  = {
    quantity.atomicUpdate(_ + 1)
    S.notice("Added One")
  }

  def render =
    "#add [onclick]" #> ajaxInvoke(increment) &
    "#quantity *" #> WiringUI.asText(quantity) &
    "#subtotal *" #> currency(subtotal)

}
---------------------------------------------------------

We have defined a `currency` method to format the `subtotal` not as a `Double` but as a currency amount using the Java number-formatting capabilities.  This will result in values like "$19.90" being shown rather than "19.9."((("S.", "notice")))


Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

The primary `WiringUI` class makes it easy to bind a cell as text. The `asText` method works by converting a value to a `String` and wrapping it in a `Text` node. This is done via `toNode`, however, we can use the `toNode` method directly
to generate a transform function that is both hooked into the wiring UI and
uses our code for the translation of the item.

The mechanism is type-safe. In this example, `cost` is a `Double` cell, `quantity` is an `Int` cell, and `subtotal` is inferred as a `Cell[Double]`.  This is why our formatting function is passed `value` as a `Double`.(((type-safe options)))

Note that the function passed to `toNode` must return a `NodeSeq`. This gives a great deal of flexibility as you can return any kind of markup in a `NodeSeq`. Our example complies with this signature by wrapping a text value in a `Text` object.

The `WiringUI.toNode` requires a `(T, NodeSeq) => NodeSeq`.  In the previous example, we ignore the `NodeSeq`, but the value would be the contents of the element we've bound to.  Given the input:

[source,html]
---------------------------------------------------------
<td id="subtotal">?</td>
---------------------------------------------------------

this would mean the `NodeSeq` passed to us would just be the text node representing "?".  With a richer template we can use CSS selectors. For example, we can modify the pass:[<phrase role='keep-together'>template:</phrase>]

[source,html]
---------------------------------------------------------
<td>Subtotal</td><td id="subtotal">
  <i>The value is <b class="amount">?</b></i>
</td>
---------------------------------------------------------

Now we can apply a CSS selector to change just the `amount` element:

[source,scala]
---------------------------------------------------------
(value, ns) => (".amount *" #> Text(formatter format value)) apply ns)
---------------------------------------------------------
