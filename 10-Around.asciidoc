Around Lift
-----------

This chapter looks at interacting with other systems from within Lift, such as sending email, calling URLs, or scheduling tasks.

Many of the recipes in this chapter have code examples in a project at https://github.com/LiftCookbook/cookbook_around[GitHub].


[[SendTextEmail]]
Sending Plain-Text Email
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

You want to send a plain-text email from your Lift application.((("Lift applications", "plain-text email in")))((("email", "plain-text")))(((Mailer)))

Solution
^^^^^^^^

Use the `Mailer`:

[source,scala]
----------------------------------------
import net.liftweb.util.Mailer
import net.liftweb.util.Mailer._

Mailer.sendMail(
  From("you@example.org"),
  Subject("Hello"),
  To("other@example.org"),
  PlainMailBodyType("Hello from Lift") )
----------------------------------------

Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

`Mailer` sends the message asynchronously, meaning `sendMail` will
return immediately, so you don't have to worry about the time costs of
negotiating with an SMTP server. There's also a `blockingSendMail`
method if you need to wait.(((SMTP servers)))

By default, the SMTP server used will be _localhost_. You can change
this by setting the `mail.smtp.host` property.
For example, edit _src/mail/resources/props/default.props_ and add the line:

[source,java]
--------------------------------
mail.smtp.host=smtp.example.org
--------------------------------

The signature of `sendMail` requires a `From`, `Subject`, and then any
number of `MailTypes`:

`To`, `CC`, and `BCC`:: The recipient email address
`ReplyTo`:: The address that mail clients should use for replies
`MessageHeader`:: Key/value pairs to include as headers in the message
`PlainMailBodyType`:: A plain-text email sent with UTF-8 encoding
`PlainPlusBodyType`:: A plain-text email, where you specify the encoding
`XHTMLMailBodyType`:: For HTML email (<<HTMLEmail>>)
`XHTMLPlusImages`:: For attachments (<<EmailWithAttachments>>)

In the example above we added two types: `PlainMailBodyType`
and `To`.  Adding more is as you'd expect:

[source,scala]
----------------------------------------
Mailer.sendMail(
  From("you@example.org"),
  Subject("Hello"),
  To("other@example.org"),
  To("someone@example.org"),
  MessageHeader("X-Ignore-This", "true"),
  PlainMailBodyType("Hello from Lift") )
----------------------------------------

The address-like `MailTypes` (`To`, `CC`, `BCC`, `ReplyTo`) can be given an optional "personal name":

[source,scala]
----------------------------------------
From("you@example.org", Full("Example Corporation"))
----------------------------------------

This would appear in your mailbox as:

----------------------------------------
From: Example Corporation <you@example.org>
----------------------------------------

The default character set is UTF-8. If you need to change this replace
the use of `PlainMailBodyType` with
`PlainPlusBodyType("Hello from Lift", "ISO8859_1")`.

[[LogEmail]]
Logging Email Rather than Sending
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

You don't want email sent when developing your Lift application locally,
but you do want to see what would have been sent.((("Lift applications", "email logging")))((("email", "logging vs. sending")))(((logging)))(((Mailer.devModeSend)))

Solution
^^^^^^^^

Assign a logging function to `Mailer.devModeSend` in _Boot.scala_:

[source,scala]
---------------------------------------------------------
import net.liftweb.util.Mailer._
import javax.mail.internet.{MimeMessage,MimeMultipart}

Mailer.devModeSend.default.set( (m: MimeMessage) =>
  logger.info("Would have sent: "+m.getContent)
)
---------------------------------------------------------

When you send an email with `Mailer`, no SMTP server will be contacted, and
instead you'll see output to your log:

---------------------------------------------------------
Would have sent: Hello from Lift
---------------------------------------------------------

Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

The key part of this recipe is setting a
`MimeMessage => Unit` function on `Mailer.devModeSend`.  We happen to be logging, but you can use this function to handle the email any way you want.

The Lift `Mailer` allows you to control how email is sent at each run mode:

`devModeSend`:: Sends email by default
`testModeSend`:: Logs only that a message would have been sent
`stagingModeSend`:: Sends email by default
`productionModeSend`:: Sends email by default
`pilotModeSend`:: Sends email by default
`profileModeSend`:: Sends email by default

The `testModeSend` logs a reference to the `MimeMessage`, meaning your log
would show a message like:

--------------------------------------
Sending javax.mail.internet.MimeMessage@4a91a883
--------------------------------------

This recipe has changed the behaviour of `Mailer` when your Lift
application is in developer mode (which it is by default). We're logging
just the body part of the message.

Java Mail doesn't include a utility to display all the
parts of an email, so if you want more information you'll need to
roll your own function.  For example(((Java Mail))):

[source,scala]
---------------------------------------------------------
def display(m: MimeMessage) : String = {

  val nl = System.getProperty("line.separator")

  val from = "From: "+m.getFrom.map(_.toString).mkString(",")

  val subj = "Subject: "+m.getSubject

  def parts(mm: MimeMultipart) = (0 until mm.getCount).map(mm.getBodyPart)

  val body = m.getContent match {
    case mm: MimeMultipart =>
      val bodyParts = for (part <- parts(mm)) yield part.getContent.toString
      bodyParts.mkString(nl)

    case otherwise => otherwise.toString
  }

  val to = for {
    rt <- List(RecipientType.TO, RecipientType.CC, RecipientType.BCC)
    address <- Option(m.getRecipients(rt)) getOrElse Array()
  } yield rt.toString + ": " + address.toString

  List(from, to.mkString(nl), subj, body) mkString nl
}

Mailer.devModeSend.default.set( (m: MimeMessage) =>
  logger.info("Would have sent: "+display(m))
)
---------------------------------------------------------

This would produce output of the form:

---------------------------------------------------------
Would have sent: From: you@example.org
To: other@example.org
To: someone@example.org
Subject: Hello
Hello from Lift
---------------------------------------------------------

This example `display` function is long but mostly straightforward. The `body` value handles multipart messages by extracting each body part.  This is triggered when sending more structured emails, such as the HTML emails(((HTML email)))((("email", "HTML"))) described in <<HTMLEmail>>.

If you want to debug the mail system while it's actually sending the email, enable the Java Mail debug mode.  In _default.props_ add:

[source, properties]
--------------------------------------
mail.debug=true
--------------------------------------

This produces low-level output from the Java Mail system when email is sent:

--------------------------------------
DEBUG: JavaMail version 1.4.4
DEBUG: successfully loaded resource: /META-INF/javamail.default.providers
DEBUG SMTP: useEhlo true, useAuth false
DEBUG SMTP: trying to connect to host "localhost", port 25, isSSL false
...
--------------------------------------

Run modes are described https://www.assembla.com/spaces/liftweb/wiki/Run_Modes[here].


[[HTMLEmail]]
Sending HTML Email
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

You want to send an HTML email from your Lift application.((("Lift applications", "HTML email")))(((Mailer)))

Solution
^^^^^^^^

Give `Mailer` a `NodeSeq` containing your HTML message:

[source,scala]
----------------------------------
import net.liftweb.util.Mailer
import net.liftweb.util.Mailer._

val msg = <html>
   <head>
     <title>Hello</title>
   </head>
   <body>
    <h1>Hello</h1>
   </body>
  </html>

Mailer.sendMail(
  From("me@example.org"),
  Subject("Hello"),
  To("you@example.org"),
  msg)
----------------------------------

Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

An implicit converts the `NodeSeq` into an `XHTMLMailBodyType`. This
ensures the mime type of the email is `text/html`. Despite the name of
"XHTML," the message is converted for transmission using
HTML5 semantics.(((HTML5 email semantics)))(((XHTMLMailBodyType)))

The character encoding for HTML email, UTF-8, can be changed by setting
`mail.charset` in your Lift properties file.(((UTF-8 character set)))

If you want to set both the text and HTML version of a message, supply each body wrapped in the appropriate `BodyType` class:

[source, scala]
---------------------------------------------------
val html = <html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello!</h1>
  </body>
</html>

var text = "Hello!"

Mailer.sendMail(
  From("me@example.org"),
  Subject("Hello"),
  To("you@example.org"),
  PlainMailBodyType(text),
  XHTMLMailBodyType(html)
)
---------------------------------------------------

This message would be sent as a `multipart/alternative`:

------------------------------------------
Content-Type: multipart/alternative;
  boundary="----=_Part_1_1197390963.1360226660982"
Date: Thu, 07 Feb 2013 02:44:22 -0600 (CST)

------=_Part_1_1197390963.1360226660982
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hello!
------=_Part_1_1197390963.1360226660982
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

<html>
      <head>
        <title>Hello</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <h1>Hello!</h1>
      </body>
    </html>
------=_Part_1_1197390963.1360226660982--
------------------------------------------

When receiving a message with this content, it is up to the mail client to decide which version to show (text or HTML).

[[AuthEmail]]
Sending Authenticated Email
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

You need to authenticate with an SMTP server to send email.((("Lift applications", "authenticated email")))((("email", "authenticated")))(((SMTP servers)))((("authentication", "for email")))

Solution
^^^^^^^^

Set the `Mailer.authenticator` in `Boot` with the credentials for your
SMTP server, and enable the `mail.smtp.auth` flag in your Lift properties
file.(((Mailer.authenticator)))

Modify _Boot.scala_ to include:

[source,scala]
--------------------------------------------------------
import net.liftweb.util.{Props, Mailer}
import javax.mail.{Authenticator,PasswordAuthentication}

Mailer.authenticator = for {
  user <- Props.get("mail.user")
  pass <- Props.get("mail.password")
} yield new Authenticator {
  override def getPasswordAuthentication =
    new PasswordAuthentication(user,pass)
}
--------------------------------------------------------

In this example, we expect the username and password to come from Lift
properties, so we need to modify
_src/main/resources/props/default.props_ to include them:

[source,scala]
------------------------------------------
mail.smtp.auth=true
mail.user=me@example.org
mail.password=correct horse battery staple
mail.smtp.host=smtp.sendgrid.net
------------------------------------------

When you send email, the credentials in _default.props_ will be used to authenticate with the SMTP server.

Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

We've used Lift properties as a way to configure SMTP authentication.
This has the benefit of allowing us to enable authentication for just
some run modes. For example, if our _default.props_ did not contain
authentication settings, but our _production.default.props_ did, then no
authentication would happen in development mode, ensuring we can't
accidentally send email outside of a production environment.

You don't have to use a properties file for this: the Lift `Mailer`
also supports JNDI, or you could look up a username and password some other way and set `Mailer.authenticator` when you have the values.((("Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI)")))(((Mailer)))

However, some mail services such as SendGrid do require `mail.smtp.auth=true` to be set, and that should go into your Lift properties file or set as a JVM argument: `-Dmail.smtp.auth=true`.(((SendGrid)))

^^^^^^^^

As well as `mail.smtp.auth`, there are a http://javamail.kenai.com/nonav/javadocs/com/sun/mail/smtp/package-summary.html[range of settings to control the Java Mail API]. Examples include controlling port numbers and timeouts.(((port numbers)))(((timeouts)))


[[EmailWithAttachments]]
Sending Email with Attachments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

You want to send an email with one or more attachments.((("Lift applications", "email attachements")))((("email", "attachments")))(((Mailer)))(((XHTMLPPlusImages)))

Solution
^^^^^^^^

Use the `Mailer` `XHTMLPlusImages` to package a message with attachments.

Suppose we want to construct a CSV file and send it via email:

[source,scala]
--------------------------------------------------------------
val content = "Planet,Discoverer\r\n" +
  "HR 8799 c, Marois et al\r\n" +
  "Kepler-22b, Kepler Science Team\r\n"

case class CSVFile(bytes: Array[Byte],
  filename: String = "file.csv",
  mime: String = "text/csv; charset=utf8; header=present" )

val attach = CSVFile(content.mkString.getBytes("utf8"))

val body = <p>Please research the enclosed.</p>

val msg = XHTMLPlusImages(body,
  PlusImageHolder(attach.filename, attach.mime, attach.bytes))

Mailer.sendMail(
  From("me@example.org",
  Subject("Planets"),
  To("you@example.org"),
  msg)
--------------------------------------------------------------

What's happening here is that our message is an `XHTMLPlusImages` instance, which accepts
a body message and attachment.  The attachment, the `PlusImageHolder`, is an `Array[Byte]`, mime type, and a filename.


Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

`XHTMLPlusImages` can also accept more than one `PlusImageHolder` if you
have more than one file to attach.  Although the name `PlusImageHolder` may suggest it is for attachment images, you can attach any kind of data as an `Array[Byte]` with an appropriate mime type.

By default the attachment is sent with an "inline" disposition. This controls the `Content-Disposition` header in the message, and "inline" means the content is intended for display automatically when the message is shown.  The alternative is "attachment," and this can be indicated with an optional final parameter to `PlusImageHolder`:

[source,scala]
--------------------------------------------------------------
PlusImageHolder(attach.filename, attach.mime, attach.bytes, attachment=true)
--------------------------------------------------------------

In reality, the mail client will display the message how it wants to, but this extra parameter may give you a little more control.


To attach a premade file, you can use `LiftRules.loadResource` to fetch content from the classpath.  As an example, if our project contained a file called _Kepler-22b_System_Diagram.jpg_ in the _src/main/resources/_ folder, we could load and attach it like this:

[source,scala]
--------------------------------------------------------------
val filename = "Kepler-22b_System_Diagram.jpg"

val msg =
  for ( bytes <- LiftRules.loadResource("/"+filename) )
  yield XHTMLPlusImages(
    <p>Please research this planet.</p>,
    PlusImageHolder(filename, "image/jpg", bytes) )

msg match {
  case Full(m) =>
    Mailer.sendMail(
      From("me@example.org"),
      Subject("Planet attachment"),
      To("you@example.org"),
      m)

  case _ =>
    logger.error("Planet file not found")
}
--------------------------------------------------------------

As the contents of _src/main/resources_ is included on the classpath, we pass the filename to `loadResource` with a leading `/` character so the file can be found at the right place on the classpath.

The `loadResource` returns a `Box[Array[Byte]]` as we have no guarantee the file will exist. We map this to a `Box[XHTMLPlusImages]` and match on that result to either send the email, or log that the file wasn't found.


See Also
^^^^^^^^

Messages are sent using the `multipart/related` mime heading, with an "inline" disposition. https://github.com/lift/framework/issues/1197[Lift ticket #1197] links to a discussion regarding "multipart/mixed" that may be preferable for working around issues with Microsoft Exchange.

http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2183.txt[RFC 2183] describes the "Content-Disposition" header.



[[RunLater]]
Run a Task Later
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

You want to schedule code to run at some future time.((("Lift applications", "delayed tasks")))(((functions, delayed execution of)))((("tasks", "delayed execution of")))(((net.liftweb.util.Schedule)))

Solution
^^^^^^^^

Use `net.liftweb.util.Schedule`:

[source,scala]
------------------------------------------------
import net.liftweb.util.Schedule
import net.liftweb.util.Helpers._

Schedule(() => println("doing it"), 30 seconds)
------------------------------------------------

This would cause "doing it" to be printed on the console 30
seconds from now.

Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

The signature for `Schedule` used above expects a function of type `() => Unit`, which is the thing we want to happen in the future, and a `TimeSpan` from Lift's `TimeHelpers` which is when we want it to happen.  The `30 seconds` value gives us a `TimeSpan` via the `Helpers._` import, but there's a variation called `perform` that accepts a `Long` millisecond value if you prefer that:

[source,scala]
------------------------------------------------
Schedule.perform(() => println("doing it"), 30*1000L)
------------------------------------------------

Behind the scenes, Lift is making use of the `ScheduledExecutorService` from `java.util.concurrent`, and as such returns a `ScheduledFuture[Unit]`.  You can use this future to `cancel` the operation before it runs.

It may be a surprise to find that you can call `Schedule` with just a function as an argument, and not a delay value.  This version runs the function immediately, but on a worker thread.  This is a convenient way to asynchronously run other tasks without going to the trouble of creating an actor for the purpose.

There is also a `Schedule.schedule` method that will send a specified
actor a specified message after a given delay.  This takes a `TimeSpan` delay, but again there's also a `Schedule.perform` version that accepts a `Long` as a delay.


See Also
^^^^^^^^

<<RunTasksPeriodically>> includes an example of scheduling with actors.

`ScheduledFuture` is documented via the http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Future.html[Java Doc for `Future`].  If you're building complex, low-level, cancellable concurrency functions, it's advisable to have a copy of _Java Concurrency in Practice_ close by (written by Goetz, _et al._, Addison-Wesley Professional).





[[RunTasksPeriodically]]
Run Tasks Periodically
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

You want a scheduled task to run periodically (repeatedly).((("Lift applications", "repeat tasks")))((("tasks", "repeat execution of")))(((net.liftweb.util.Schedule)))

Solution
^^^^^^^^

Use `net.liftweb.util.Schedule` ensuring that you call `schedule` again
during your task to reschedule it. For example, using an actor:

[source,scala]
-------------------------------------------------
import net.liftweb.util.Schedule
import net.liftweb.actor.LiftActor
import net.liftweb.util.Helpers._

object MyScheduledTask extends LiftActor {

  case class DoIt()
  case class Stop()

  private var stopped = false

   def messageHandler = {
     case DoIt if !stopped =>
        Schedule.schedule(this, DoIt, 10 minutes)
       // ... do useful work here

     case Stop =>
       stopped = true
   }
}
-------------------------------------------------

The example creates a `LiftActor` for the work to be done. On receipt of
a `DoIt` message, the actor reschedules itself before doing whatever
useful work needs to be done. In this way, the actor will be called
every 10 minutes.

Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

The `Schedule.schedule` call is ensuring that `this` actor is sent the
`DoIt` message after 10 minutes.

To start this process off, possibly in _Boot.scala_, just send the
`DoIt` message to the actor:

[source,scala]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
MyScheduledTask ! MyScheduledTask.DoIt
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To ensure the process stops correctly when Lift shuts down, we register
a shutdown hook in _Boot.scala_ to send the `Stop` message to prevent
future reschedules:

[source,scala]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
LiftRules.unloadHooks.append( () => MyScheduledTask ! MyScheduledTask.Stop )
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Without the `Stop` message the actor would continue to be rescheduled
until the JVM exits. This may be acceptable, but note that during
development with SBT, without the `Stop` message, you will continue to
schedule tasks after issuing the `container:stop` command.

Schedule returns a `ScheduledFuture[Unit]` from the Java concurrency
library, which allows you to `cancel` the activity.

See Also
^^^^^^^^

Chapter 1 of _Lift in Action_ by Perrett, (Manning Publications, Co.) includes a Comet Actor clock example that uses `Schedule`.



[[FetchURLs]]
Fetching URLs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

You want your Lift application to fetch a URL, and process it as text, JSON, XML, or HTML.((("Lift applications", "fetching URLs")))

Solution
^^^^^^^^

Use _Dispatch_, "a library for asynchronous HTTP interaction."

Before you start, include Dispatch dependency in _build.sbt_:

[source,scala]
-------------------------------------------------
libraryDependencies += "net.databinder.dispatch" %% "dispatch-core" % "0.9.5"
-------------------------------------------------

Using the example from the Dispatch documentation, we can make an HTTP request to try to determine the country from the service at http://www.hostip.info/use.html[http://www.hostip.info/use.html]:

[source,scala]
------------------------------------------
import dispatch._
val svc = url("http://api.hostip.info/country.php")
val country : Promise[String] = Http(svc OK as.String)

println(country())
------------------------------------------

Note that the result `country` is not a `String` but a `Promise[String]`, and we `apply` to wait for the resulting value.

The result printed will be a country code such as `GB`, or `XX` if the country cannot be determined from your IP address.

Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

This short example expects a 200 (OK) status result and turns the result into a `String`, but that's a tiny part of what Dispatch is capable of.  We'll explore further in this section.

What if the request doesn't return a 200? In that case, with the code we have, we'd get an exception such as: "Unexpected response status: 404." There are a few ways to change that.

We can ask for an `Option`:

[source,scala]
------------------------------------------
val result : Option[String] = country.option()
------------------------------------------

As you'd expect, this will give a `None` or `Some[String]`. However, if you have debug level logging enabled in your application you'll see the request and response and error messages from the underlying Netty library.  You can tune these messages by adding a logger setting to _default.logback.xml_ file:

[source, xml]
------------------------------------------
<logger name="com.ning.http.client" level="WARN"/>
------------------------------------------

A second possibility is to use `either` with the usual convention that the `Right` is the expected result and `Left` signifies a failure:

[source,scala]
------------------------------------------
country.either() match {
  case Left(status) => println(status.getMessage)
  case Right(cc) => println(cc)
}
------------------------------------------

This will print a result as we are forcing the evaluation with an apply via `either()`.

`Promise[T]` implements `map`, `flatMap`, `filter`, `fold` and all the usual methods you'd expect to allow you to compose.  This means you can use the promise with a `for` pass:[<phrase role='keep-together'>comprehension:</phrase>]

[source,scala]
------------------------------------------
val codeLength = for (cc <- country) yield cc.length
------------------------------------------

Note that `codeLength` is a `Promise[Int]`.  To get the value you can evaluate `codeLength()` and you'll get a result of `2`.

As well as extracting string values with `as.String`, there are other options, including:

`as.Bytes`:: To work with `Promise[Array[Byte]]`.
`as.File`:: To write to a file, as in `Http(svc > as.File(new File("/tmp/cc")) )`.
`as.Response`:: To allow you to provide a `client.Response => T` function to use on the response
`as.xml.Elem`:: To parse an XML response

As an example of `as.xml.Elem`:

[source,scala]
------------------------------------------
val svc = url("http://api.hostip.info/?ip=12.215.42.19")
val country  = Http(svc > as.xml.Elem)
println(country.map(_ \\ "description")())
------------------------------------------

This example is parsing the XML response to the request, which returns a `Promise[scala.xml.Elem]`.  We're picking out the description node of the XML via a `map`, which will be a `Promise[NodeSeq]` that we then force to evaluate.  The output is something like:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------
<gml:description
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xmlns:gml="http://www.opengis.net/gml">
     This is the Hostip Lookup Service
</gml:description>
------------------------------------------

That example assumes the request is going to be well formed. In addition to the core Databinder library, there are extensions for JSoup and TagSoup to assist in parsing HTML that isn't necessarily well formed.

For example, to use JSoup, include the dependency:

[source,scala]
-------------------------------------------------
libraryDependencies += "net.databinder.dispatch" %% "dispatch-jsoup" % "0.9.5"
-------------------------------------------------

You can then use the features of JSoup, such as picking out elements of a page using CSS selectors:

[source,scala]
-------------------------------------------------
import org.jsoup.nodes.Document

val svc = url("http://www.example.org").setFollowRedirects(true)
val title = Http(svc > as.jsoup.Document).map(_.select("h1").text).option
println( title() getOrElse "unknown title" )
-------------------------------------------------

Here we are applying JSoup's `select` function to pick out the `<h1>` element on the page, taking the text of the element which we turn into a `Promise[Option[String]]`.  The result, unless _example.org_ has changed, will be "Example Domain."

As a final example of using Dispatch, we can pipe a request into Lift's JSON library:

[source,scala]
-------------------------------------------------
import net.liftweb.json._
import com.ning.http.client

object asJson extends (client.Response => JValue) {
  def apply(r: client.Response) = JsonParser.parse(r.getResponseBody)
}

val svc = url("http://api.hostip.info/get_json.php?ip=212.58.241.131")
val json : Promise[JValue] = Http(svc > asJson)

case class HostInfo(country_name: String, country_code: String)
implicit val formats = DefaultFormats

val hostInfo = json.map(_.extract[HostInfo])()
-------------------------------------------------


The URL we're calling returns a JSON representation for location information of the IP address we've passed.

By providing a `Response => JValue` to Dispatch we're able to pass the response body through to the JSON parser. We can then map on the `Promise[JValue]` to apply whatever Lift JSON functions we want to. In this case, we're extracting a simple case class.

The result from the above would show `hostInfo` as:

[source,scala]
-------------------------------------------------
HostInfo(UNITED KINGDOM,GB)
-------------------------------------------------

The previous major version of Dispatch, 0.8.x ("Dispatch Classic"), is quite different from the "reboot" of the project as version 0.9.  Consequently, examples you may see that use 0.8.x will need some conversion to run with 0.9.x. http://code.technically.us/post/17038250904/fables-of-the-reconstruction-part-2-have-you-tried[Nathan Hamblen's blog] describes the change.
