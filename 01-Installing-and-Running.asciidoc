Install and Running
-------------------

This chapter covers questions around starting development with Lift.
You'll find hints about production deployment in later chapters.

Downloading and Running Lift
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

You want to install and run Lift on your computer.

Solution
^^^^^^^^

The only prerequisite for installing and running Lift is to have Java
1.5 or later installed. Instructions for installing Java can be found at
http://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp[http://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp].

Once you have Java, the following instructions will download, build and
start a basic Lift application.

For Mac and Linux
+++++++++++++++++

* Visit http://liftweb.net/download[http://liftweb.net/download] and download the Lift 2.5-M3 ZIP file.
* Unzip the file.
* Start Terminal or your favourite shell tool.
* Navigate into the unzipped folder and into the `scala_2.9` sub-folder and then the lift_blank` folder.
* Run:`./sbt`.
* Required libraries will be downloaded automatically.
* At the SBT prompt (>) type: `container:start`.
* Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`.

For Windows
+++++++++++

* Visit http://liftweb.net/download[http://liftweb.net/download] and download the Lift 2.5-M3 ZIP file.
* Extract the contents of the ZIP file.
* Navigate in Explorer to the extracted folder, and inside there navigate into `scala_2.9` and then `lift_blank`. 
* Double click `sbt.bat` and a terminal window should open.
* Required libraries will be downloaded automatically.
* At the SBT prompt (>) type: `container:start`.
* Start your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`

Expected result
+++++++++++++++

The result of the above commands should be a basic Lift application running on
your computer:

Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

Lift isn't installed in the usual sense of "installing software".
Instead it uses standard build tools, such as SBT or Maven, to assemble
your application with the Lift framework. This recipe has
downloaded a ZIP containing four bare-bones Lift applications, and then started 
one of them via the build too.

Typing `sbt` starts the Simple Build Tool, a dependency management
tool used by Scala projects. It will check the project and download any
libraries required by this Lift application. 

The command `container:start` starts the web server on the default port of 8080 and
passes requests to the Lift application. The word "container" refers to the
software you deploy your application into. There are a variety of containers (Jetty and 
Tomcat are probably the best known) all of which conform to a standard for deployment.  
The upshot is you can build your application and deploy to whichever one you prefer.  
The `container:start` command uses Jetty.

Your application build is configured by `build.sbt`.  Looking inside you'll see:

* basic information about your application, including a name and version;
* resolvers, which inform SBT where to fetch dependencies from;
* settings for plugins and the Scala compiler; and
* a list of dependencies required to run your application on Lift.

The source code of the application resides in `src/main/webapp` and `src/main/scala`.

Developing Using a Text Editor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

You want to develop your Lift application using your favourite text
editor, hitting reload in your browser to see changes.

Solution
^^^^^^^^

Run SBT while you are editing to handle compilation of Scala files.

Start `sbt` and enter the following to the SBT prompt:

--------------------------------------
~; container:start; container:reload /
--------------------------------------

When you save a source file in your editor, SBT will detect this,
compile the file, and reload the web container.

Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

An SBT command prefixed with `~` makes that command run when files
change. The first semicolon introduces a sequence of commands, where if
the first command succeeds, the second will run. The second semicolon
means the `reload` command will run if the `start` command ran OK.

The restarting of the web container isn't always as efficient as you'd
like. This can often be avoided by using JRebel, which will be the
subject of a future recipe.

Developing using Eclipse
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

You want to develop your Lift application using the Eclipse IDE, hitting
reload in your browser to see changes.

Solution
^^^^^^^^

You will need to have the http://scala-ide.org/[Scala IDE for Eclipse]
installed. There is a link in the See also section with instructions how
to accomplish this.

To create the project files for Eclipse, add the following to
`plugins.sbt`, which can be found in the `project` directory:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe.sbteclipse" % "sbteclipse-plugin" % "2.0.0")
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

You can then create Eclipse project files within SBT by entering the
following:

------- 
eclipse
-------

In Eclipse, navigate to "File > Import.." and select "General > Existing
Projects into Workspace". Navigate to and select your Lift project. You
are now set up to develop you application in Eclipse.

Run SBT while you are editing to handle reloads of the web container.
Start `sbt` from a terminal window outside of Eclipse and enter the
following:


--------------------------------------
~; container:start; container:reload /
--------------------------------------

You can then edit in Eclipse, and in your web browser hit reload to see
the change.

Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

You can also force the SBT `eclipse` command to download the Lift
source. This will allow you to click through to the Lift source from
methods and classes. To achieve this once, run
`eclipse with-source=true`, but if you want this to be the default
behaviour, add the following to your `build.sbt` file:

------------------------------
EclipseKeys.withSource := true
------------------------------

If you find yourself using the plugin frequently, you may wish to set it
in your global SBT configuration files: `~/.sbt/plugins/build.sbt` for
the module definition and `~/.sbt/user.sbt` for any settings.

The restarting of the web container isn't always as efficient as you'd
like. This can often be avoided by using JRebel, which will be the
subject of a future recipe.

Viewing the lift_proto H2 Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

You're developing using the default `lift_proto.db` H2 database, and
you'd like use a tool to look at the tables.

Solution
^^^^^^^^

Use the web interface included as part of H2, as documented in the first _See Also_ link. +
Here are the steps:

* Locate the H2 JAR file. For me, this was: `~/.ivy2/cache/com.h2database/h2/jars/h2-1.2.147.jar`.
* Start the server from a terminal window using the JAR file you found: `java -cp /path/to/h2-version.jar org.h2.tools.Server`
* This should launch your web browser, asking you to login.
* Select "Generic H2 Server" in "Saved Settings".
* Enter `jdbc:h2:/path/to/youapp/lift_proto.db;AUTO_SERVER=TRUE` for "JDBC URL", adjusting the path for the location of your database, and adjusting the name of the database ("lift_proto.db") if different in your `Boot.scala`.
* Press "Connect" to view and edit your database.

Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

Using the connection information given here and in the links below, you
should be able to configure other SQL tools to access the database.

Using the latest Lift build
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

You want to use the latest build ("snapshot") of Lift.

Solution
^^^^^^^^

You need to make two changes to your `build.sbt` file. First, reference
the snapshot repository:

----
resolvers += "snapshots" at "http://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots"
----

Second, change the `liftVersion` in your build to be 2.5-SNAPSHOT,
rather than 2.4:

--------------------------------
val liftVersion = "2.5-SNAPSHOT"
--------------------------------

Restarting SBT (or issuing a `reload` command) will trigger a download
of the latest build.

Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

Production releases of Lift (e.g., "2.4"), as well as milestone releases
(e.g., "2.4-M1") and release candidates (e.g., "2.4-RC1") are published
into a releases repository. When SBT downloads them, they are downloaded
once.

Snapshot releases are different: they are the result of an automated
build, and change often. You can force SBT to resolve the latest
versions by running the command `clean` and then `update`.

Using a New Version of Scala
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

A new Scala version has just been released and you want to immediately
use it in your Lift project.

Solution
^^^^^^^^

You may find that the latest SNAPSHOT of Lift is built using the latest
Scala version. Failing that, and assuming you cannot wait for a build,
providing that the Scala version is binary compatible with the latest
version used by Lift, you can change your build file to force the Scala
version.

For example, assuming your `build.sbt` file is set up to use Lift 2.4
with Scala 2.9.1:

[source,scala]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
scalaVersion := "2.9.1"

libraryDependencies ++= {
  val liftVersion = "2.4" 
  Seq(
    "net.liftweb" %% "lift-webkit" % liftVersion % "compile->default"
  )    
}
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's assume that you now want to use Scala 2.9.2 but Lift 2.4 was only
built against Scala 2.9.1. Replace `%%` with `%` for the `net.liftweb`
resources and explicitly include the Scala version that Lift was built
against for each Lift component:

[source,scala]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
scalaVersion := "2.9.2"

libraryDependencies ++= {
  val liftVersion = "2.4" 
  Seq(
    "net.liftweb" % "lift-webkit_2.9.1" % liftVersion % "compile->default"
  )    
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

In the example we have forced SBT to explicitly fetch the 2.9.1 version
of the Lift resources rather than allow it to compute the URL to the
Lift components.

Please note this only works for minor releases of Scala: major releases
break compatibility.
