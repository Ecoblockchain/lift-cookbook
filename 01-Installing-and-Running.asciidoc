Installing and Running Lift
---------------------------

This chapter covers questions regarding starting development with Lift: running a first Lift application and setting up a coding environment. You'll find answers regarding production deployment in <<deployment>>.

[[DownloadAndRun]]
Downloading and Running Lift
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

You want to install and run Lift on your computer.((("Lift Web Framework", "downloading")))

Solution
^^^^^^^^

The only prerequisite for installing and running Lift is to have Java
1.5 or later installed. Instructions for installing Java can be found at
http://java.com/[http://java.com/].

You can find out if you have Java from the shell or command prompt by asking for the version you have installed((("Java, installation of"))):

----------------------------------------------------------------
$ java -version
java version "1.7.0_13"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_13-b20)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 23.7-b01, mixed mode)
----------------------------------------------------------------

Once you have Java, the following instructions will download, build, and
start a basic Lift application.(((Lift applications, basic instructions)))

For Mac and Linux
+++++++++++++++++

* Visit http://liftweb.net/download[http://liftweb.net/download] and download the Lift 2.5-RC5 ZIP file.
* Unzip the file.
* Start Terminal or your favourite shell tool.
* Navigate into the unzipped folder and into the _scala_29_ subfolder and then into the _lift_basic_ folder.
* Run:`./sbt`.
* Required libraries will be downloaded automatically.
* At the SBT prompt (>), type: `container:start`.
* Open your browser and go to _http://127.0.0.1:8080/_.
* When you're done, type `exit` at the SBT prompt to stop your application from running.

For Windows
+++++++++++

* Visit http://liftweb.net/download[http://liftweb.net/download] and locate the link to the ZIP version of Lift 2.5-RC5 and save this to disk.
* Extract the contents of the ZIP file.
* Navigate in Explorer to the extracted folder, and inside navigate into _scala_29_ and then _lift_basic_.
* Double-click _sbt.bat_ to run the build tool; a terminal window should open.
* Required libraries will be downloaded automatically.
* At the SBT prompt (>), type: `container:start`.
* You may find Windows Firewall blocking Java from running. If so, opt to "allow access."
* Start your browser and go to _http://127.0.0.1:8080/_.
* When you're done, type `exit` at the SBT prompt to stop your application from running.

Expected result
+++++++++++++++

The result of the above commands should be a basic Lift application running on
your computer as shown in <<LiftBasicScreenshot>>.

Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

Lift isn't installed in the usual sense of "installing software."
Instead, you use standard build tools, such as SBT or Maven, to assemble your application with the Lift framework. In this recipe, we downloaded a ZIP file containing four fairly minimal Lift applications, and then started one of them via the build tool.((("Lift Web Framework", "vs. conventional software")))

Simple Build Tool
+++++++++++++++++

Typing `sbt` starts a _Simple Build Tool_ used by Scala projects (it's not specific to Lift).  SBT will check the project definition and download any libraries required, which will include the Lift framework.((("Simple Build Tool (SBT)", "starting")))

This download happens once, and the downloaded
files are stored on disk in _.ivy2_ under your home folder.

Your application build is configured by _build.sbt_.  Looking inside, you'll see((("build.sbt, contents"))):

* Basic information about your application, including a name and version;
* Resolvers, which inform SBT where to fetch dependencies from;
* Settings for plugins and the Scala compiler; and
* A list of dependencies required to run your application, which will include the Lift framework.

[[RunningYourApplication]]
Running your application
++++++++++++++++++++++++

The SBT command `container:start` starts the web server on the default port of 8080 and
passes requests to your Lift application. The word _container_ refers to the
software you deploy your application into. There are a variety of containers (_Jetty_ and
_Tomcat_ are probably the best known) all of which conform to a standard for deployment.
The upshot is you can build your application and deploy to whichever one you prefer.
The `container:start` command uses Jetty.(((Lift applications, running)))((("containers", "types of")))(((Jetty)))(((Tomcat)))

Source code
+++++++++++

The source code of the application resides in _src/main/webapp_ and _src/main/scala_. If you take a look at _index.html_ in the _webapp_ folder, you'll see mention of `lift:helloWorld`. That's a reference to the class defined in _scala/code/snippet/HelloWorld.scala_. This is a _snippet invocation_ and an example of Lift's _view first_ approach to web applications. That is, there's no routing set up for the index page to collect the data and forward it to the view. Instead, the view defines areas of the content that are replaced with functions, such as those functions defined in _HelloWorld.scala_.(((snipet invocation)))((("view first approach, definition of")))((("Lift Web Framework", "view first approach of")))(((Lift applications, source code for)))(((source code)))

Lift knows to look in the `code` package for snippets because that package is declared as a location for snippets in _scala/bootstrap/liftweb/Boot.scala_. The Boot class is run when starting your application, and it's where you can configure the behaviour of Lift.

[[LiftFromScratch]]
Creating a Lift Project from Scratch Using SBT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

You want want to create a Lift web project from scratch without using the ZIP files provided on the official Lift website.

Solution
^^^^^^^^

You will need to configure SBT and the Lift project yourself. Luckily, only five small files are needed.((("Simple Build Tool (SBT)", "configuration of")))(((Lift applications, creating from scratch)))

First, create an SBT plug-in file at _project/plugins.sbt_ (all file names are given relative to the project root directory):

[source,scala]
---------------------------------------------------------
libraryDependencies <+= sbtVersion(v => v match {
  case "0.11.0" => "com.github.siasia" %% "xsbt-web-plugin" % "0.11.0-0.2.8"
  case "0.11.1" => "com.github.siasia" %% "xsbt-web-plugin" % "0.11.1-0.2.10"
  case "0.11.2" => "com.github.siasia" %% "xsbt-web-plugin" % "0.11.2-0.2.11"
  case "0.11.3" => "com.github.siasia" %% "xsbt-web-plugin" % "0.11.3-0.2.11.1"
  case x if x startsWith "0.12" =>
    "com.github.siasia" %% "xsbt-web-plugin" % "0.12.0-0.2.11.1"
})
---------------------------------------------------------

This file tells SBT that you will be using the `xsbt-web-plugin` and chooses the correct version based upon your version of SBT.

Next, create an SBT build file, _build.sbt_:

[source,scala]
---------------------------------------------------------
organization := "org.yourorganization"

name := "liftfromscratch"

version := "0.1-SNAPSHOT"

scalaVersion := "2.10.0"

seq(com.github.siasia.WebPlugin.webSettings :_*)

libraryDependencies ++= {
  val liftVersion = "2.5-RC5"
  Seq(
    "net.liftweb" %% "lift-webkit" % liftVersion % "compile",
    "org.eclipse.jetty" % "jetty-webapp" % "8.1.7.v20120910"  % 
      "container,test",
    "org.eclipse.jetty.orbit" % "javax.servlet" % "3.0.0.v201112011016" %
      "container,compile" artifacts Artifact("javax.servlet", "jar", "jar")
  )
}
---------------------------------------------------------

Feel free to change the various versions, though be aware that certain versions of Lift are only built for certain versions of Scala.

Now that you have the basics of an SBT project, you can launch the `sbt` console. It should load all the necessary dependencies, including the proper Scala version, and bring you to a prompt.

Next, create the following file at _src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml_:

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------------------------
<!DOCTYPE web-app SYSTEM "http://java.sun.com/dtd/web-app_2_3.dtd">
<web-app>
  <filter>
    <filter-name>LiftFilter</filter-name>
    <display-name>Lift Filter</display-name>
    <description>The Filter that intercepts Lift calls</description>
    <filter-class>net.liftweb.http.LiftFilter</filter-class>
  </filter>
  <filter-mapping>
    <filter-name>LiftFilter</filter-name>
    <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
  </filter-mapping>
</web-app>
---------------------------------------------------------

The _web.xml_ file tells web containers, such as Jetty as configured by `xsbt-web-plugin`, to pass all requests on to Lift.

Next, create a sample _index.html_ file at _src/main/webapp/index.html_ for our Lift app to load. For example:

[source,html]
---------------------------------------------------------
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Lift From Scratch</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome, you now have a working Lift installation</h1>
  </body>
</html>
---------------------------------------------------------

Finally, set up the basic Lift boot settings by creating a _Boot.scala_ file at _src/main/scala/bootstrap/Boot.scala_. The following contents will be sufficient:

[source,scala]
---------------------------------------------------------
package bootstrap.liftweb

import net.liftweb.http.{Html5Properties, LiftRules, Req}
import net.liftweb.sitemap.{Menu, SiteMap}

/**
 * A class that's instantiated early and run.  It allows the application
 * to modify lift's environment
 */
class Boot {
  def boot {
    // where to search snippet
    LiftRules.addToPackages("org.yourorganization.liftfromscratch")

    // Build SiteMap
    def sitemap(): SiteMap = SiteMap(
      Menu.i("Home") / "index"
    )

    // Use HTML5 for rendering
    LiftRules.htmlProperties.default.set((r: Req) =>
      new Html5Properties(r.userAgent))
  }
}
---------------------------------------------------------

Congratulations, you now have a working Lift project!

You can verify that you have a working Lift project by launching the Jetty web container from the SBT console with the `container:start` command. First, the _Boot.scala_ file should be compiled and then you should be notified that Jetty has launched and is listening at _http://localhost:8080_. You should be able to go to the address in your web browser and see the rendered _index.html_ file you created earlier.(((Lift applications, verification of)))

Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

As shown above, creating a Lift project from scratch is a relatively simple process. However, it can be a tricky one for newcomers, especially if you are not used to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) ecosystem and its conventions for web containers. If you run into problems, make sure the files are in the correct locations and that their contents were not mistakenly modified. If all else fails, refer to the sample project below or ask for help on the http://groups.google.com/group/liftweb[Lift mailing list].((("containers", "troubleshooting")))((("Java Virtual Machine (JVM)", "troubleshooting")))((("web containers", seealso="containers")))

Lift projects using SBT or similar build tools follow a standard project layout, where Scala source code is in _src/main/scala_ and web resources are in _src/main/webapp_. Your Scala files must be placed either directly at _src/main/scala_ or in nested directories matching the organization and name you defined in _build.sbt_, in our case giving us _src/main/scala/org/yourorganization/liftfromscratch/_. Test files match the directory structure but are placed in _src/test/_ instead of _src/main/_. Likewise, the _web.xml_ file must be placed in _src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/_ for it to be properly detected.((("Simple Build Tool (SBT)", "standard layout with")))(((Lift applications, standard layout of)))(((source code)))(((directory structure)))

Given these conventions, you should have a directory structure looking quite, if not exactly, like this:

---------------------------------------------------------
- project root directory
  | build.sbt
  - project/
    | plugins.sbt
  - src/
    - main/
      - scala/
        - bootstrap/
          | Boot.scala
        - org/
          - yourorganization/
            - liftfromscratch/
              | <your Scala code goes here>
      - webapp/
        | index.html
        | <any other web resources - images, HTML, JavaScript, etc - go here>
        - WEB-INF/
          | web.xml
    - test/
      - scala/
        - org/
          - yourorganization/
            - liftfromscratch/
              | <your tests go here>

[[texteditor]]
Developing Using a Text Editor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

You want to develop your Lift application using your favourite text
editor, hitting reload in your browser to see changes.(((Lift applications, text editor development)))((("text editors, development with")))((("browsers, reloading")))

Solution
^^^^^^^^

Run SBT while you are editing, and ask it to detect and compile changes to Scala files.  To do that, start `sbt` and enter the following to the SBT prompt((("Simple Build Tool (SBT)", "text editor develoment with"))):

--------------------------------------
~; container:start; container:reload /
--------------------------------------

When you save a source file in your editor, SBT will detect this change,
compile the file, and reload the web container.

Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

An SBT command prefixed with `~` makes that command run when files
change. The first semicolon introduces a sequence of commands, where if
the first command succeeds, the second will run. The second semicolon
means the `reload` command will run if the `start` command ran OK. The `start`
command will recompile any Scala source files that have changed.

When you run SBT in this way, you'll notice the following output:

----------------------------------------------------------
1. Waiting for source changes... (press enter to interrupt)
-----------------------------------------------------------

And indeed, if you do press Enter in the SBT window, you'll exit this _triggered
execution_ mode and SBT will no longer be looking for file changes. However, while
SBT is watching for changes, the output will indicate when this happens with something
that looks a little like this(((triggered execution mode)))((("Simple Build Tool (SBT)", "triggered execution mode"))):

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[info] Compiling 1 Scala source to target/scala-2.9.1/classes...

[success] Total time: 0 s, completed 15-Nov-2012 18:14:46
2. Waiting for source changes... (press enter to interrupt)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Edits to HTML files don't trigger the SBT compile and reload commands.
This is because SBT's default behaviour is to look for
Scala and Java source file changes, and also changes to files in _src/main/resources/_.
This works out just fine, because Jetty will use your modified HTML file when you
reload the browser page.

Restarting the web container each time you edit a Scala file isn't ideal. You can reduce
the need for restarts by integrating JRebel into your development environment, as described
in <<jrebel>>.(((web containers)))((("browsers, reloading")))((("JRebel", "reducing restarts with")))

However, if you are making a serious number of edits, you may prefer to issue a `container:stop` command until you're ready to run you application again with `container:start`. This will prevent SBT compiling and restarting your application over and over. The SBT console has a command history, and using the up and down keyboard arrows allows you to navigate to previous commands and run them by pressing the Return key.  That takes some of the tedium out of these long commands.((("Simple Build Tool (SBT)", "command history in")))((("error messages", "java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: PermGen space")))

One error you may run into is:

------------------------------------------
java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: PermGen space
------------------------------------------

The _permanent generation_ is a Java virtual machine concept. It's the area of memory used for storing classes (amongst other things).  It's a fixed size and once it is full this PermGen error appears.  As you might imagine, continually restarting a container causes many classes to be loaded and unloaded, but the process is not perfect, effectively leaking memory. The best you can do is stop and then restart SBT.  If you're seeing this error often, check the setting for `-XX:MaxPermSize` inside the _sbt_ (or _sbt.bat_) script, and if you can, double it.((("Java Virtual Machine (JVM)", "troubleshooting")))(((permanent generation)))

[[jrebel]]
Incorporating JRebel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

You want to avoid application restarts when you change a Scala source file by using JRebel.((("JRebel", "reducing restarts with")))((("browsers, reloading")))

Solutions
^^^^^^^^^

There are three steps required: install JRebel once; each year request the free Scala license; and configure SBT to use JRebel.((("Simple Build Tool (SBT)", "using JRebel with")))(((Scala, license for)))((("license, for Scala")))

First, visit https://my.jrebel.com/plans[https://my.jrebel.com/plans] and request the free Scala license.

Second, download the "Generic ZIP Archive" version of JRebel, unzip it to where you like. For this recipe, I've chosen to use _/opt/zt/jrebel/_.

When you have received your account confirmation email from JRebel, you can copy your "authentication token" from the "Active" area of ZeroTurnaround's site. To apply the token to your local install, run the JRebel configuration script(((authentication tokens))):

---------------------------------------
$ /opt/zt/jrebel/bin/jrebel-config.sh
---------------------------------------

For Windows, navigate to and launch _bin\jrebel-config.cmd_.

In the "Activation" setting, select "I want to use myJRebel" and then in the "License" section paste in your activation token. Click the "Activate" button, and once you see the license status change to "You have a valid myJRebel token" click "Finish."

Finally, configure SBT by modifying the _sbt_ script to enable JRebel.  This means setting the `-javaagent` and `-noverify` flags for Java, and enabling the JRebel Lift plugin.

For Mac and Linux, the script that's included with the Lift downloads would become:

--------------------------
java -Drebel.lift_plugin=true -noverify -javaagent:/opt/zt/jrebel/jrebel.jar \
 -Xmx1024M -Xss2M -XX:MaxPermSize=512m -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled -jar \
 `dirname $0`/sbt-launch-0.12.jar "$@"
--------------------------

For Windows, modify _sbt.bat_ to be:

--------------------------
set SCRIPT_DIR=%~dp0
java -Drebel.lift_plugin=true -noverify -javaagent:c:/opt/zt/jrebel/jrebel.jar \
 -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled -XX:MaxPermSize=256m -Xmx1024M -Xss2M \
 -jar "%SCRIPT_DIR%\sbt-launch-0.12.jar" %*
--------------------------

There's nothing else to do to use JRebel.  When you start SBT, you'll see a large banner stating something like this:

---------------------------
#############################################################

  JRebel 5.1.1 (201211271929)
  (c) Copyright ZeroTurnaround OU, Estonia, Tartu.

  Over the last 30 days JRebel prevented
  at least 335 redeploys/restarts saving you about 13.6 hours.
....
---------------------------

With JRebel installed, you can now `container:start` your application, modify and compile a Scala file, and reload a page in your application. You'll see a notice that the class has been reloaded:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2012-12-16 23:15:44] JRebel: Reloading class 'code.snippet.HelloWorld'.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

That change is live, without having to restart the container.

Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

JRebel is very likely to speed up your development. It updates code in a running Java virtual machine, without having to stop and restart it.  The effect is that, on the whole, you can compile a class, then hit reload in your browser to see the change in your Lift application.((("Java Virtual Machine (JVM)", "troubleshooting")))((("JRebel", "reducing restarts with")))((("browsers, reloading")))(((Lift applications, speeding development of)))

Even with JRebel you will need to restart your applications from time to time, but JRebel usually reduces the number of restarts. For example, _Boot.scala_ is run when your application starts, so if you modify something in your _Boot.scala_, you'll need to stop and start your application. JRebel can't help with that.

But there are also other situations that JRebel cannot help with, such as when a superclass changes. Generally, JRebel will emit a warning about this in the console window.  If that happens, stop and start your application.(((superclass changes)))

The `-Drebel.lift_plugin=true` setting adds Lift-specific functionality to JRebel.  Specifically, it allows JRebel to reload changes to `LiftScreen`, `Wizard`, and `RestHelper`. This means you can change fields or screens, and change REST `serve` code.((("Drebel plugin)))(((LiftScreen)))(((Wizard)))(((RestHelper)))


Purchased licenses
++++++++++++++++++

This recipe uses a free Scala license for a service called myJRebel. This communicates with JRebel servers via the activation code.  If you have purchased a license from ZeroTurnaround, the situation is slightly different.  In this case, you will have a license key that you store in a file called _jrebel.lic_. You can place the file in a _.jrebel_ folder in your home directory, or alongside _jrebel.jar_ (e.g., in the _/opt/zt/jrebel/_ folder if that's where you installed JRebel), or you can specify some other location.  For the latter option, modify the _sbt_ script and specify the location of the file by adding another Java setting((("license, for Scala")))(((Scala, license for)))(((ZeroTurnaround))):

-----------------------------------
-Drebel.license=/path/to/jrebel.lic
-----------------------------------

[[eclipse]]
Developing Using Eclipse
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

You want to develop your Lift application using the Eclipse IDE, hitting
reload in your browser to see changes.(((Lift applications, Eclipse IDE development)))((("Eclipse IDE, development in")))

Solution
^^^^^^^^

Use the "Scala IDE for Eclipse" plugin to Eclipse, and the _sbteclipse_ plugin for SBT.  This will give Eclipse the ability to understand Scala, and SBT the ability to create project files that Eclipse can load.(((Scala IDE for Eclipse plugin)))((("Simple Build Tool (SBT)", "Eclipse plugin for")))

The instructions for the Eclipse plugin are given at http://scala-ide.org[http://scala-ide.org]. There are a number of options to be aware of when picking an update site to use: there are different sites for Scala 2.9 and 2.10, and for different versions of Eclipse. Start with the _stable_ version of the plugin rather than a nightly or milestone version. This will give you an Eclipse perspective that knows about Scala.

Once the Eclipse plugin is installed and restarted, you need to create the project files to allow Eclipse to load your Lift project. Install "sbteclipse" by adding the following to _projects/plugins.sbt_ in your Lift project:

[source,scala]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe.sbteclipse" % "sbteclipse-plugin" % "2.1.2")
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

You can then create Eclipse project files (_.project_ and _.classpath_) by entering the following into the SBT prompt:

-------
eclipse
-------

Open the project in Eclipse by navigating to "File > Import..." and selecting "General > Existing Projects into Workspace." Browse to and choose your Lift project. You are now set up to develop your application in Eclipse.

To see live changes as you edit and save your work, run SBT in a separate terminal window.  That is, start _sbt_ from a terminal window outside of Eclipse and enter the following:

--------------------------------------
~; container:start; container:reload /
--------------------------------------

The behaviour of this command is described in <<texteditor>>, but if you're using JRebel (see <<jrebel>>) then you just need to run `container:start` by itself.

You can then edit in Eclipse, save to compile, and in your web browser hit reload to see
the changes.

Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

One of the great benefits of an IDE is the ability to navigate source, by Cmd+click (Mac) or F3 (PC).
You can ask the SBT `eclipse` command to download the Lift
source and Scaladoc, allowing you to click through to the Lift source from
methods and classes, which is a useful way to discover more about Lift.((("Cmd+click shortcut")))((("F3 shortcut")))((("Lift Web Framework", "learning more about")))

To achieve this in a project, run `eclipse with-source=true` in SBT, but if you want
this to be the default behaviour, add the following to your _build.sbt_ file:

[source,scala]
------------------------------
EclipseKeys.withSource := true
------------------------------

If you find yourself using the plugin frequently, you may wish to declare it
in your global SBT configuration files so it applies to all projects.  To do that,
create a _~/.sbt/plugins/plugins.sbt_ file containing:

[source,scala]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
resolvers += Classpaths.typesafeResolver

addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe.sbteclipse" % "sbteclipse-plugin" % "2.1.2")
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note the blank line between the `resolvers` and the `addSbtPlugin`.  In _.sbt_ files, a blank line is required between statements.

Finally, set any global configurations (such as `withSource`) in _~/.sbt/global.sbt_.

Developing Using IntelliJ IDEA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

You want to use the IntelliJ IDEA development environment when writing your Lift application.(((Lift applications, IntelliJ IDEA development)))((("IntelliJ IDEA development environment")))

Solution
^^^^^^^^

You need the Scala plugin for IntelliJ, and an SBT plugin to generate the IDEA project files.

The IntelliJ plugin you'll only need to install once, and these instructions are for IntelliJ IDEA 12.  The details may vary between releases of the IDE, but the basic idea is to find the JetBrains Scala plugin, and download and install it.

From the "Welcome to IntelliJ IDEA" screen, select "Configure" and then "Plugins." Select "Browse repositories..." In the search box, top right, type "Scala."  You'll find on the left a number of matches: select "Scala."  On the right, you'll see confirmation that this is the "Plugin for Scala language support" and the vendor is JetBrains, Inc. Select the "Download and Install" icon from the top of the window, or right-click to download and install. "Close" the dialog, and OK out of the plugins window. You'll be prompted to restart IntelliJ IDEA.

With the IDE configured, you now need to add the SBT plugin inside your Lift project by adding the following to the file _projects/plugins.sbt_:

[source,scala]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
addSbtPlugin("com.github.mpeltonen" % "sbt-idea" % "1.4.0")
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Start SBT, and at the SBT prompt create the IDEA project files by typing:

---------
gen-idea
---------

This will generate the _.idea_ and _.iml_ files that IntelliJ uses. Inside IntelliJ you can open the project from the "File" menu, picking "Open..." and then navigating to your project and selecting the directory.

To see live changes as you edit and save your work, run SBT in a separate terminal window.  That is, start _sbt_ from a terminal window outside of IntelliJ and enter the following:

--------------------------------------
~; container:start; container:reload /
--------------------------------------

This behaviour of this command is described in <<texteditor>>, but if you're using JRebel (see <<jrebel>>) then you just need to run `container:start` by itself.

Each time you compile or make the project, the container will pick up the changes, and you can see them by reloading your browser window.

Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

By default, the `gen-idea` command will fetch source for dependent libraries. That means out of the box you can click through to Lift source code to explore it and learn more about the framework.

If you want to try the latest snapshot version of the plugin, you'll need to include the snapshot repository in your _plugin.sbt_ file:

[source,scala]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
resolvers += "Sonatype snapshots" at
  "http://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/"
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Setting up the SBT IDEA plugin globally, for all SBT projects, is the same pattern as described for Eclipse in <<eclipse>>.

[[ViewH2]]
Viewing the lift_proto H2 Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

You're developing using the default _lift_proto.db_ H2 database, and
you would like to use a tool to look at the tables.(((Lift applications, lift_proto.db H2 database for)))((("lift basic H2 database")))(((H2 Database Engine)))((("tables, viewing")))(((databases, viewing)))

Solution
^^^^^^^^

Use the web interface included as part of H2. Here are the steps:

* Locate the H2 JAR file. For me, this was: _~/.ivy2/cache/com.h2database/h2/jars/h2-1.2.147.jar_.
* Start the server from a Terminal window using the JAR file you just found: `java -cp /path/to/h2-version.jar org.h2.tools.Server`
* This should launch your web browser, asking you to login.
* Select "Generic H2 Server" in "Saved Settings."
* Enter _jdbc:h2:/path/to/youapp/lift_proto.db;AUTO_SERVER=TRUE_ for "JDBC URL," adjusting the path for the location of your database, and adjusting the name of the database (_lift_proto.db_) if different in your _Boot.scala_.
* Press "Connect" to view and edit your database.

Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

The default Lift projects that include a database, such as _lift_basic_, use the H2 relational database, as it can be included as an SBT dependency and requires no external installation or configuration. It's a fine product, although production deployments typically use standalone databases, such as PostgreSQL or MySQL.(((databases, alternative)))(((production deployments, databases for")))

Even if you're deploying to a non-H2 database it may be useful to keep H2 around because it has an in-memory mode, which is great for unit tests. This means you can create a database in-memory, and throw it away when your unit test ends.((("unit tests", "H2's in-memory mode and")))(((in-memory mode)))

If you don't like the web interface, the connection settings described in this recipe should give you the information you need to configure other SQL tools.

If you're using the console frequently, consider making it accessible from your Lift application in development node. This is described by Diego Medina in a https://fmpwizard.telegr.am/blog/lift-and-h2[blog post].

[[snapshot]]
Using the Latest Lift Build
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

You want to use the latest ("snapshot") build of Lift.((("Lift Web Framework", "latest build of")))(((snapshot releases)))((("Lift Cookbook", "software versions used in")))

Solution
^^^^^^^^

You need to make two changes to your _build.sbt_ file. First, reference
the snapshot pass:[<phrase role='keep-together'>repository:</phrase>]

[source,scala]
----
resolvers += "snapshots" at
  "http://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots"
----

Second, change the `liftVersion` in your build to be the latest version. For this example, let's use the 2.6 snapshot version of Lift:

[source,scala]
--------------------------------
val liftVersion = "2.6-SNAPSHOT"
--------------------------------

Restarting SBT (or issuing a `reload` command) will trigger a download
of the latest build.

Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

Production releases of Lift (e.g., "2.4," "2.5"), as well as milestone releases
(e.g., "2.5-M3") and release candidates (e.g., "2.5-RC1") are published
into a releases repository. When SBT downloads them, they are downloaded
once.(((production releases)))(((milestone releases)))(((release candidates)))(((releases repository)))

Snapshot releases are different: they are the result of an automated
build, and change often. You can force SBT to resolve the latest
versions by running the command `clean` and then `update`.

[[NewScala]]
Using a New Version of Scala
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

A new Scala version has just been released and you want to immediately
use it in your Lift project.(((Scala, changing versions of)))

Solution
^^^^^^^^

You may find that the latest snapshot of Lift is built using the latest
Scala version. Failing that, and assuming you cannot wait for a build, you may still be in luck.
Providing that the Scala version is _binary compatible_ with the latest
version used by Lift, you can change your build file to force the Scala
version.(((binary compatibility)))

For example, assuming your _build.sbt_ file is set up to use Lift 2.5
with Scala 2.9.1:

[source,scala]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
scalaVersion := "2.9.1"

libraryDependencies ++= {
  val liftVersion = "2.5"
  Seq(
    "net.liftweb" %% "lift-webkit" % liftVersion % "compile->default"
  )
}
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's assume that you now want to use Scala 2.9.3 but Lift 2.5 was only
built against Scala 2.9.1. Replace `%%` with `%` for the `net.liftweb`
resources and explicitly include the Scala version that Lift was built
against for each Lift component:

[source,scala]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
scalaVersion := "2.9.3"

libraryDependencies ++= {
  val liftVersion = "2.5"
  Seq(
    "net.liftweb" % "lift-webkit_2.9.1" % liftVersion % "compile->default"
  )
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

What we've done here is change the `scalaVersion` to the new version we want
to use, but explicitly specified we want the 2.9.1 Scala version for Lift.
This works because the two different Scala versions are binary compatible.

Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

Dependencies have a particular naming convention.  For example, the `lift-webkit` library for Lift 2.5-RC5 is called _lift-webkit_2.9.1-2.5-RC5.jar_.  Normally, in _build.sbt_ we simply refer to `"net.liftweb" %% "lift-webkit"` and SBT turns that into the name of a file that can be downloaded.((("dependencies, naming conventions of")))((("names/naming", "of dependencies")))

However, in this recipe we have forced SBT to explicitly fetch the 2.9.1 version
of the Lift resources rather than allow it to compute the URL to the
Lift components.  This is the difference between using `%%` and `%` in a
dependency: with `%%` you do not specify the Scala version, as SBT will append
the `scalaVersion` number automatically; with '%' this automatic change is not made,
so we have to manually specify more details for the name of the library.

Please note this only works for minor releases of Scala: major releases
break compatibility.  For example, Scala 2.9.1 is compatible with Scala 2.9.0, but not 2.10.
