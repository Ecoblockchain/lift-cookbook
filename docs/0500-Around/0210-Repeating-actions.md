Run tasks periodically
======================

Problem
-------

You want a scheduled task to run periodically.


Solution
--------

Use `net.liftweb.util.Schedule` ensuring you call `schedule` during your task. For example:

```scala
import net.liftweb.util.Schedule
import net.liftweb.actor.LiftActor
import net.liftweb.util.Helpers._

object MyScheduledTask extends LiftActor {
  
  case class DoIt()
  case class Stop()
  
  var stopped = false
  
  def schedule = Schedule.schedule(this, DoIt, 10 minutes)
  
   def messageHandler = {  
     case DoIt => 
       if (!stopped) schedule // re-schedule in another 10 mins  
       // ... do useful work here
     
     case Stop =>
       stopped = true
   }
}
```

The example creates a `LiftActor` for the work to be done. The `schedule` method uses Lift's `Schedule.schedule` method to ensure that `this` actor is sent the `DoIt` message after 10 minutes.  On receipt of the message, we are re-scheduling ourselves before doing whatever it is we need to do.

To start this process off, possibly in `Boot.scala`, you could send the `DoIt` message to the actor, or more conveniently simply call `MyScheduledTask.schedule`.

To ensure the process stops correctly when Lift shuts down, we send a `Stop` message to prevent future re-schedules:

```scala
LiftRules.unloadHooks.append( () => MyScheduledTask ! MyScheduledTask.Stop )
```

Discussion
----------

Without the `Stop` message your actor would continue to be rescheduled until the JVM exits. This may be acceptable, but note that during development with SBT, without the `Stop` message, you will continue to schedule tasks after issuing the `container:stop` command.

Schedule return a `ScheduledFuture[Unit]` from the Java concurrency library, which allows you to `cancel` the activity.
