Model a column with MySQL's MEDIUMTEXT
======================================

Problem
-------

You want to use MySQL's `MEDIUMTEXT` for a column, but `StringField` doesn't have this option.

Solution
--------

Use Squeryl's `dbType`:

```scala
on(mytable)(t => declare(
  t.mycolumn defineAs dbType("MEDIUMTEXT")
))
```

Discussion
----------

You can continue to use `StringField`, but regardless of the size you pass, the schema will be:

```sql
create table mytable (
    mycolumn MEDIUMTEXT not null
);
```

This recipe is not specific to Lift, and will work wherever you use Squeryl.
