DRY URLs
========

Problem
-------

You found yourself repeating parts of URL paths in your RestHelper, and you Don't want to Repeat Yourself.

Solution
--------

Use `prefix` in your RestHelper:

```scala
object RestAPI extends RestHelper {

  serve("bugs" / "by-state" prefix {
    case "open" :: Nil JsonGet _ => <p>None open</p>
    case "closed" :: Nil JsonGet _ => <p>None closed</p>
    case state :: Nil JsonDelete _ => <p>All deleted</p>
  })

}
```


Discussion
----------

You can have many `serve` blocks in your `RestHelper`, which helps give your REST service structure.
