Returning JSON
==============

Problem
-------

You want to return JSON from a REST call.

Solution
--------

Use the JSON DSL.  For example:

```scala
package code.lib

import net.liftweb.http.rest._
import net.liftweb.json.JObject
import net.liftweb.json.JsonDSL._

object QuotationAPI extends RestHelper {

 serve {
  case "quotation" :: Nil JsonGet _ => 
   ("text" -> "A beach house isn't just real estate. It's a state of mind.") ~ 
   ("by" -> "Douglas Adams") : JObject
 }

}
```

Wire this into `Boot.scala`:

```scala
LiftRules.statelessDispatch.append(code.lib.QuotationAPI)
```

Running this example produces:

```
\$ curl -H 'Content-type: text/json' http://127.0.0.1:8080/quotation
{
  "text":"A beach house isn't just real estate. It's a state of mind.",
  "by":"Douglas Adams"
}
```


Discussion
----------

The "type ascription" at the end of the JSON expression (`: JObject`) tells the compiler that the expression is expected to be of type `JObject`.  This is required to allow the DSL to work.  If would not be required if, for example, you were calling a function that was defined to return a `JObject`.

The JSON DSL allows you to created nested structures, lists and everything else you expect of JSON.  The _Readme_ in the _See Also_ section is a great place to read about the library.

* The [Lift JSON Readme](https://github.com/lift/framework/tree/master/core/json) is a great source of documentation and examples of using the JSON package in Lift.
