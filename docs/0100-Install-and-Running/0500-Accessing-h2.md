Viewing the lift_proto H2 database
===================================

Problem
-------

You're developing using the default `lift_proto.db` H2 database, and you'd like use a tool to look at the tables.


Solution
---------

Use the web interface included as part of H2, as documented in the first _See Also_ link.  
Here are the steps:

* Locate the H2 JAR file.  For me, this was: `~/.ivy2/cache/com.h2database/h2/jars/h2-1.2.147.jar`.
* Start the server from a terminal window using the JAR file you found: `java -cp /path/to/h2-version.jar org.h2.tools.Server`
* This should launch your web browser, asking you to login.
* Select "Generic H2 Server" in "Saved Settings".
* Enter `jdbc:h2:/path/to/youapp/lift_proto.db;AUTO_SERVER=TRUE` for "JDBC URL", adjusting the path for the location of your database, and adjusting the name of the database ("lift_proto.db") if different in your `Boot.scala`.
* Press "Connect" to view and edit your database.
