== Preface

This is a collection of solutions to questions you might have while developing
web applications with the Lift Web Framework.((("Lift Web Framework", "prerequisites")))

The aim is to give a single, short answer to a specific question. When there's more than approach, or style, we'll give you one solution, but will point you at alternatives in the discussion.

<<InstallAndRunning>> will get you up and running with Lift, but in other respects this cookbook is aimed at practitioners and the questions they have asked. If this is the first time you've heard of Lift, you'll want to look at:

* http://simply.liftweb.net[_Simply Lift_]

* Torsten Uhlmann's _Instant Lift Web Applications How-to_ (PACKT Publishing)

* Timothy Perrett's _Lift in Action_ (Manning Publications)

=== Using Code Examples

This book is here to help you get your job done. In general, if this book includes code examples, you may use the code in this book in your programs and documentation. You do not need to contact us for permission unless you’re reproducing a significant portion of the code. For example, writing a program that uses several chunks of code from this book does not require permission. Selling or distributing a CD-ROM of examples from O’Reilly books does require permission. Answering a question by citing this book and quoting example code does not require permission. Incorporating a significant amount of example code from this book into your product’s documentation does((("Lift Cookbook", "code use permissions"))) require pass:[<phrase role='keep-together'>permission.</phrase>]

=== Acknowledgments

These recipes exist because of the many contributions on the Lift mailing list, where _Liftafarians_, as they are known, generously give their time to ask questions, put together example projects, give answers, share alternatives, and chip in with comments. Thank you.

I also want to thank those who have provided corrections to the recipes, on the mailing list, GitHub, and Twitter.  No matter what else it means, writing on the Web and publishing on the Web has meant I've received some prompt, high-quality feedback.

I am indebted to the contributors who have taken the trouble to write new recipes for this book.
