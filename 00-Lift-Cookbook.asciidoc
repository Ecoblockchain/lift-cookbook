About this text
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A collection of solutions to questions you might have while developing
web applications with the http://www.liftweb.net[Lift web framework].

The aim is to give a single, short answer to a specific question. Where
there are different ways to achieve the same result, this cookbook just
shows one way, but may point you at alternatives in a discussion on the
solution.
